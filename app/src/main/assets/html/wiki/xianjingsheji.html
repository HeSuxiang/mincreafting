<p>陷阱可以在玩家不在时对目标造成伤害。但不是所有的陷阱都是隐藏的，可视陷阱能使玩家触发它之前引起一种很安全的感受。在下文中, 陷阱的目标可能是一个人或一群人, 并且并不是所有的陷阱都同样奏效。
</p>

<h2>陷阱部分</h2>
<p>为了描述一个陷阱, 我们必须将其分成几个部分。大多数陷阱有三个部分。我们将会在下面详细介绍。
</p>
<ul><li> 触发器。触发器就是使陷阱开始运作的部分，它往往被目标触发。</li>
<li> 连环陷阱。它们能使陷阱更有效率，但不是必需的。</li>
<li> 方法。方法是目标被处置的方式，方法也是对目标造成伤害的方式。</li></ul>

 <p>  <b>触发</b></p> 
<p>触发器激活陷阱，大多使用红石制作而成，但类似的触发器也是可以的(比如水冲掉火把)。触发器往往安装在不引人注目的地方最为有效，它可以是门旁边的一个按钮或者压力板，这样的陷阱往往超出预期。
</p>

<ul><li> 压力板当有人站在上面时就发出信号，离开时就不发送，永远不变。 A pressure plate can be attached to an RS NOR latch to stabilize the signal. 通过把压力板放在一个亮度很低的区域，可以很好地隐藏压力板，并且需要把压力板放置在一个任何玩家都会通过的小道内。
</li><li> 按钮 creates a short pulse and can be attached to an RS NOR latch or T flip-flop to stabilize the signal. 如果按钮被用作触发器的话，目标一定会被欺骗，相信这个按钮是用于其它功能的（比如用来开门或调整灯光）。
</li><li> 如果一个方块被插上了红石火把（火把不能被看到），那么破坏火把所在的方块也可作为触发器。这个骗局是目标凭他们自己的意愿挖掉方块而造成的，可用一些珍贵方块来作为诱饵，如钻石块或金块等。。
</li><li> 水 currents can be updated by an adjacent block update. This can be seen when redstone redirects water but also works with doors activated by hand and furnaces. The updated water flow would then knock out a redstone torch, creating the signal.
</li><li> BUD Switch A BUD switch can be used to trigger a trap if a door, or chest is opened. They can also detect other block state changes
</li><li> Some players have experimented with the ability to pick up an item through a corner. The item is placed on a wooden pressure plate, the deactivation of which creates a signal. The item will disappear after 5 minutes, so the trap is unstable without a pre-trigger complications. This trigger also assumes the target has room in their inventory for the item being used. Arrows tend to be used because many players carry arrows and probably wouldn't notice an extra. This trigger is much more hidden than others, almost any corner can be a trigger. A tutorial video explaining this type of trigger is shown below.
</li> </ul>

   <p>  <b>连环陷阱</b></p> 
  <p>A complication is any part between the trap triggering and the method being employed. Many more complications exist than just those below. Complications tend to add a delay to the trap, which is usually not desirable.
</p>
<ul><li> 红石钟可以用来产生周期性的脉冲。This is almost always used with arrow dispensers or a trap that is triggered periodically such as a piston grinder.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  RS NOR latch / T flip-flop  These circuits take a short pulse and stabilize it. An RS NOR latch uses two inputs, one to set the signal, and another to reset it. The reset switch would be away from the target. A T flip-flop uses only one input which toggles the signal. This is less common in traps than an RS NOR latch because the target could have a chance to reset the trap before he is killed.</li></ul>
<ul><li> False walls (pistons/gravity). False walls hide important parts. This is a complication in that it does not deal damage, but hides the method, thus giving the target a false sense of security. Pistons can easily place and replace false walls, but redstone wiring can be difficult to hide in an open area. Sand and gravel can be used as an airlock to reveal important parts by using water to knock down the supporting torch, but this requires manual reseting every time the trap is triggered.</li></ul>
<ul><li> 洞可以被认为是一个难题，因为它迫使目标处在一个较小的区域，而不是对它们造成伤害。 For the sake of this tutorial, a hole is a non-fatal fall, and a pit is a fatal fall. Like a pit, the target is often pushed into it.</li></ul>
<ul><li> 水的推动能力有限，但对于如僵尸这一类没有多大抵抗力的生物而言，水的推动很有效率。水流在僵尸农场里是常常被用来运输僵尸的，但当用于运输玩家时效率极低。</li></ul>


 <p>  <b>方法</b></p> 
<p>该方法是玩目标造成伤害的可靠方法。这种陷阱通是隐藏起来的，所以目标不会察觉即将到来的危险。关于计算伤害的更多细节，请阅读<a href="/%E4%BC%A4%E5%AE%B3" title="伤害">伤害</a>。
</p>
<ul><li> 使用一个坑，当目标坠落了超过3格方块高时，它受到伤害的影响。坠落得越深，伤害越高。通常是运用活塞把目标推进了坑里而导致的坠落。这些陷阱很容易构建，而且僵尸可以被吸引，并被推倒陷阱中，但这些陷阱庞大，且较难收集掉落物。鸡不受摔落伤害。如果陷阱使用伪装的地板，通常会要求目标是玩家。</li></ul>
<ul><li> Lava is a dangerous fluid to use. Any mob caught in lava will take periodic damage from it as well as periodic fire damage. Since lava spreads slowly the lava source should be close to the target, so he doesn't have much time to attempt an escape. Lava will destroy any item that falls in it. It can be used effectively in an enclosed space and triggered by a ceiling floodgate. Alternatively, a hole filled with lava which the target is pushed into doesn't require time for the lava to spread. It is also advisable to line such a hole with a block such as a furnace, so that the victim cannot place blocks to escape.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Water is difficult to use because there can be air pockets if the source blocks are too spread out. All players and mobs have an air meter than must run out before they begin taking damage, players may have enough time to mine an air pocket and escape unharmed. Drowning is uncommon in traps for players but is often found in mob traps or mob grinders.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Suffocation. A player or mob whose upper body is in a solid block will take suffocation damage. This can be accomplished by dropping sand or gravel in the target. However, players are pushed into an open space if possible to avoid suffocation damage. If a player can quickly mine out the block causing the damage, that player will stop taking damage and may be able to escape. Using pistons to push the block into the player is an effective method if you know exactly where the player will be.</li></ul>
<ul><li> 箭 can deal damage to players either by being propelled by TNT, dropped from a trapdoor, or most commonly, from a dispenser. Arrows from TNT can not be reliably directed. Arrows dropped from a trapdoor can only cause minimal damage to the target. Dispensers can fire very rapidly, and far which makes them ideal for an enclosed space like a tunnel. The dispenser must be reloaded from time to time.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Hostile mobs can be used to deal damage to the target, assuming the target is a player. The trapper collects mobs either by a [mob farm] or manually lures them into a hole. The target is either dropped into the hole with the mobs or the mobs are released into the same room as the target. The mob sounds could make the target more cautious.</li></ul>
<ul><li> TNT is a common way to dispatch the target. It deals major damage to the target and has a fairly short fuse, which means less time for the target to react. It doesn't destroy the items dropped by the target. TNT does, however, destroy surrounding blocks unless it detonates in a fluid (water or lava). Many players use this property to create traps that can be reused. Players also may make traps that purposefully destroy massive areas by chaining TNT together. When TNT is ignited, it becomes an entity which means it no longer supports other blocks. This can be used as the trigger for an airlock which can trap the player in the area until the TNT explodes.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Cactus deal damage whenever the target is in contact. Like lava, cactus destroy any items that comes into contact with it. Cacti must have all four cardinal blocks empty to be legally placed. Having the cactus grow into an illegal block is howcactus farms are built, and sending mobs through a cactus farm may be an effective grinder.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Not all traps have a method. Traps can be used to live capture players or mobs. Since players can mine and place blocks, they are much more difficult to live capture.</li></ul>

<h2>使用的术语</h2>
<p>Let's create some simple traps to describe the parts we just discussed:
</p><p><b>Example 1</b>
</p><p>A miner is digging away a 2x1 tunnel. He finds gold ore, but once he mines it arrows are relentlessly shot at him.
</p><p>On the back of the ore is a redstone torch that acts as the <b>trigger</b> by sending a signal once broken. This signal allows a rapid pulsar (<b>complication</b>) to repeatedly send power to a dispenser, the <b>method</b>.
</p><p><b>Example 2</b>
</p><p>An explorer comes across a cave. He drops down a few blocks when he notices it's getting lighter instead of darker. He jumps to his next ledge just before a flow of lava engulfs his previous position.
</p><p>Since our trapper can't maintain the trap consistently without drawing suspicion, let's assume he sets up a redstone clock to a dispenser. Every four and a half minutes a new item will be dispensed, maintaining the trap. Clocks are generally a complication, but since it is used to stabilize the trigger we'll call it part of the trigger.
This trap is hidden in a natural location and uses an invisible <b>trigger</b> (an item through the wall). This opens a flood gate of lava (<b>method</b>) in the entrance, it will spread and trap the explorer in the cave.
</p><p><b>Example 3</b>
</p><p>The owner of a large underground mansion is being chased by another player. The owner escapes through an iron door controlled by a pressure plate. On the other side he hits a button.
The pursuer sees him open the door by the pressure plate and follows him. But the door doesn't open. Instead a series of pistons opens a hole and pushes the assailant into it. Once the pistons extinguish the light from the opening, it is pitch black.
</p><p>The button on the far side of the door is a safety attached to a T-flip flop. It engages the <b>trigger</b> (the pressure plate), which, until a moment ago, was pretty uninteresting. Both sets of pistons (The ones that opened the hole and the ones that pushed the assailant) are <b>complications</b>. The obsidian jail is a live-capture <b>method</b>.
</p><p><b>Example 4</b>
</p><p>A robber has snuck into a large obsidian-reinforced storage facility and walks into a room with a red wool floor. He hears an audible click before the opposite wall is pulled away revealing dispensers that start to pelt him with splash potions of poison and slowness. Before he can get away a 9 block TNT charge goes off but since the room is reinforced the facility as a whole escapes unscathed.
</p><p>The pressure plate in the door is the trigger. The piston-removed false wall is a complication. The dispensers are a method. However there is a 6 second repeater delay (complication) connected to a secondary method (bomb).
</p>


<h2>保险装置</h2>
<p>使用红石的任何陷阱可以放置一个拉杆来创建一个安全开关。这个开关可以被激活，让陷阱制造者执行维护或安全通过。The simplest way to do this is to construct an AND gate, using a lever as one of the power sources. When active, the AND gate functions as a double NOT gate.
</p><p>Generally, the AND gate is placed between the trigger and the rest of the wiring, but this may not be the case for all traps.
</p>


<h2>解除陷阱</h2>
<p>Traps are not designed to be found and immediately lose effectiveness once discovered. That being said, disarming a trap will require an understanding of the trap and there is no guarantee you'll survive the disarming process.
The more traps you disarm, the more proficient you'll be at it.
But if you come across a something suspicious that you don't recognize, here are a few tricks:
</p>
<ul><li> Don't alter any redstone (either active or inactive) unless you can see the entire circuit. Even inactive redstone can be part of a really long clock.</li>
<li> If you find the method, disable that (take arrows out of a dispenser, take TNT, knock down cacti, take/fill in lava). It may be a two method trap, so you're not necessarily safe yet.</li>
<li> If all else fails, try to safely trigger the trap. Either step on the trigger and run, or use redstone to trigger it from a distance. It is best to have a good understanding of the nature of the trap before attempting to trigger it, as one can easily underestimate its size.</li>
<li> Another way to disarm a trap is to explode it with TNT. This doesn't work with bedrock and obsidian.</li></ul>
<p>Anti-tampering complications are rare. So when a player incorporates one into their trap, it will often be something of their own design. Synchronized clocks are probably the most common and will trigger a defense mechanism if one is desynchronized.
</p>


<h2>僵尸磨床</h2>
<p>Mob grinders are an integral part of a mob farm. One way to think of a mob farm is as one entirely self-sufficient trap. The spawning of mobs is the trigger, canals are a complication and the grinder is the method. We'll only be looking at mob grinders here.</a>.
</p><p>Water streams push the target into the grinder. Grinders don't work well with players because they can fight the current or disrupt it by placing blocks.
</p>
<ul><li> A piston smasher trap uses a piston to periodically suffocate trapped mobs. Mobs can be packed together by dropping them into the smasher. The design to the right can not process a massive amount of mobs at once, since mobs will push against each other and clog the machine. The smasher to the right will eventually work through a build up of mobs though. Also, this design doesn't work for spiders.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Lava grinders push the mob into a suspended stream of lava. Most items will be preserved and can be collected using additional water streams. Since lava grinders are a light source, it must be put away from the spawning pads as to not interfere with mob spawning.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Drowning grinders use water to deal damage to mobs. Mobs will float when in solid water source blocks and eventually drown if they don't find an air pocket.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Sunlight chamber deal damage to zombies and skeletons. A benefit of this is the ability to sort out creepers, spiders and endermen. The obvious disadvantage to this is it only functions half the time.</li></ul>
