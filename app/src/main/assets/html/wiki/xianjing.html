<p><i>本页面是针对玩家的陷阱，对于杀死其他生物获得战利品的装置，请见 教程/刷怪塔，怪物磨床。</i>
</p><p><b>陷阱</b>是一个在多人游戏中由玩家制造的、用于自动伤害或杀死其他玩家或怪物的机关。以下是一些简单的陷阱以及它的制造方法，读者需具备一些简单的机关制造原理，方能了解其中的奥妙。 陷阱也是机械里的一部分。

 

<h2>陷阱的艺术</h2>
<p>陷阱是一些被设计成自动捕捉或猎杀一个实体(通常叫做怪物磨床)或玩家，它可能是瞬间或长时间的。
</p><p>多数的陷阱可以不那么费力的建造出来，但是某些需要MCedit或者作弊来快速建造。
</p>

<h2>基本陷阱</h2>
<p>这里的陷阱都只抓新手玩家，但是他们都是那些高级的陷阱的本质。
</p>


 <p>  <b>	新手箱子陷阱
</b></p> <p>这个陷阱<b>非常</b>简单，<b>非常</b>狡猾，也<b>非常</b>有用。先建造一个2*2的坑直至基岩层。(如果你正在玩一个多人领地服务器，那这是最佳选择，否则就没有关系)在离基岩层三格高上时，放置四个漏斗，再在每一个漏斗上放一个板砖，然后往漏斗下面放箱子。然后，建造一条道路回到地面。环绕洞口摆四个大箱子(总计八个箱子)。尝试着潜行着离开箱子的顶部，你会发现并不能阻止掉落！玩家无法阻挡向下看的冲动，所以当他们向下看时，他们会想着潜行可以让他们不会摔下去。他们瞬间就会因为摔落而掉出身上所有的物品。
</p>

 <p>  <b>	伪造区块错误
</b></p> 
<p>挖一个16*16，至少23格深的洞 (最好沿着区块的边界) 并将其连接到你屋子中存放战利品的箱子，加上一个用来烧矿的熔炉(强烈推荐穿上至少铁制装甲和装备铁剑，虽然皮革和木剑也能做到，毕竟在多数情况下，只有新手会掉进来)，然后添加一个像写着“免费钻石”的告示牌或者放置一格煤矿的诱饵，(因为它是唯一在地表同高度的地方生成的矿石，或者是铁矿等其他矿石看起来很可疑)并将它伪装成一个石坑，因此当他们在顶上挖矿或者是他们跳进来的时候，他们会死于摔落伤害。如果没有(可能由于他们穿着有摔落保护的靴子或末影珍珠掉下来/升上去)，就用你的剑干掉他们。如果你认为你有足够的技术并且你觉得你不再需要这个陷阱了，你可以将它做成一个怪物磨床。你也可以加上铁轨和它连接起来，或用机械开挖来来把玩家推下去，如果你能承受开销的话。建造这样一个陷阱很费时间，但是如果正确建造好了这个陷阱，它会以更丰厚的利润回报你。
</p>

 <p>  <b>	自掘坟墓—玩弄信任
</b></p> 
<p>请求某人帮你在一个地方挖洞，你在那里丢了许多钻石，如果他们找到了它们，你要分给他们一半。当他们挖的足够深的时候，你可以用沙子或者沙砾来埋葬他们！你也可以用熔岩来创造一个更戏剧性的场面。
</p>

 <p>  <b>	落沙
</b></p> 
<p>这个陷阱需要：
</p>
<ul><li> 沙子或者沙砾(任意数量)、</li>
<li> 活板门、</li>
<li> 深坑(至少15格深)、</li>
<li> 一把铲子(哪种都可以)</li></ul>
<p>挖一个15格(或更深)的洞，然后在顶上三格放一个陷阱门，然后放1～2格沙子。当你的目标走在那格沙子上时，破坏陷阱门。噗！目标就掉到坑里面了，留在那里以备日后使用，或者瞬间窒息而亡。
</p>

 <p>  <b>	区块加载陷阱 - 用途不明的触发式陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>需要：红石、生物、矿车以及/或者其他只在玩家加载区块时才工作的器械。
</p><p><b>注意：这陷阱可能不会像你期望的那样工作。</b>
你可以使用那些只在玩家加载区块时才启动的机械。你可以在屋子里面藏一大捆将在玩家加载区块时炸开的TNT！
</p>

 <p>  <b>基础的TNT陷阱 - 地雷</b></p> 
<p>你需要：一个方块、TNT、和一个压力板。
</p>


<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing1.png" />
<br />这个陷阱第二个变种的模板。
</p>
<p>
在至少一个TNT上放置压力板。当一个玩家踏上它的时候， TNT就会被启动并点燃。这就是在Minecraft中最基本的TNT陷阱，其他所有TNT陷阱都建立在这个陷阱之上。另外一个方法是向下挖4格，在从下往上数第二格放置一个TNT。在上面放一格沙子/沙砾。然后放一个压力板在上面。当有玩家或者生物踩上压力板时，沙子会掉落，TNT会点燃，那个不幸的玩家会被困在一个地板上有一个触发了的TNT的洞里。这个陷阱的缺点就是每一次使用完了过后玩家需要重新建造它。
</p><p>注意：那个方块<b>必须是沙子或者沙砾！</b>
</p>


 <p>  <b>新手想要所有的木头</b></p> 
<p>这个简单的陷阱是对树进行一些操作。当一些玩家想着砍掉所有木头这样其他玩家就不能拥有时，他们会被炸得粉碎！
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i9nWwEI0oI?">https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i9nWwEI0oI?</a></p>

  <p>  <b>爆炸门 - 伪装
</b></p> 
<p>建造这个陷阱需要：一个吸引玩家们的诱饵(箱子、钻石等)、TNT、一扇门(铁门最好，但木门也可以)、两个压力板或者按钮。
可选：沙子/沙砾。(沙砾更适合石质压力板)
要制作这个陷阱，先挖一个小隧道或者建一个小房子，在里面放上诱饵。然后在入口处放一扇含压力板或按钮的门。在门的朝屋子里面的那一面向下挖两格，如果有沙子或沙砾则可以挖更多。然后回到顶端，在从上往下数第二格放一个TNT，然后盖住它(很像上面做的地雷)，然后等待触发。
这个想法针对在谨慎开了门之后看见了压力板的人，他们会认为这个压力板是用来开门的，然后就走进去了。
</p>

 <p>  <b>“无害”的陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>你将需要：9个TNT、1个木质压力板、1个活塞、1块沙子或砂砾、1个拉杆、1块石头(不是圆石)和4个红石粉。
</p><p>1. 向下挖3个方块。.
</p><p>2. 在你的下方放一块石头。
</p><p>3. 挖一个4方块长的通道。
</p><p>4. 在通道的尽头放上木质压力板。
</p><p>5. 放上红石线到另一端。
</p><p>6. 在这一段挖一个3x3x1的洞。
</p><p>7.用TNT填充洞。
</p><p>8. 用周围环境的方块覆盖洞。
</p><p>9. 在TNT洞旁放上沙子或沙砾。
</p><p>10. 放一个活塞面对沙子或沙砾。
</p><p>11.放一个红石中继器对着活塞。
</p><p>12. 在红石旁放一个拉杆。
</p><p>玩家会以为拉杆是用来移除沙子的。如果他拉下了拉杆，沙子将掉落到压力板上激活压力板，然后引燃TNT。Boom！
</p>

 <p>  <b>别拉拉杆！
</b></p> 
<p>我设计了这个叫做“别拉拉杆”的陷阱，它很容易连接到其他东西上。
</p>
<p>这个陷阱是建立在这些基础内容之上的：
</p>
<p>The basis of this trap is as follows: On (say) a factions smp server you have a traitor new to your faction who tries to steal the faction valuables. They go into the valuables room. They see your chest blocked by a block above it. Next to the chest is a lever and a sign saying "Pull lever to lift block above chest up" or something convincing. They flick the lever - which they THINK will let them open the chest. Instead, it activates lava coming from the ceiling/the floor retracting/ suffocating gravel or sand /a light... basically it can activate anything that can be turned on by pulling a single lever. How do you actually access the chest? Well, the "solid block" above it is actually a stair block, facing in a way so that you see a full side of a block but you can actually open a chest that has a stair block above it. So - if you're smart, and you find a seemingly locked chest, then.... Don't Pull the Lever!
</p>
 <p>  <b>简单的树陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>你将需要：1个木质压力板、1个容易破坏的方块(如木板)，还有大量TNT。
</p>
<p>找到你想设置陷阱的树，把最底下的方块挖掉，再在底下挖一个4格深的洞。把TNT放在下面，然后放方块和木质压力板。 当有人挖掉树最下面的方块时，方块将会落到压力板上，引燃TNT。这个陷阱并不总是有效，因为有人可能打破树上的其他方块。掉落物也可能在掉到压力板上前被玩家捡走, so a trap using the block's absence instead of the drop's presence would be best if possible, for example if the tree is touching a 2-block-high wall then the bottom block of it could be replaced with an inverter mechanism and death mechanism and the block below the tree could be replaced with a Redstone Torch.
</p>
 <p>  <b>死亡之屋 - 奇袭
</b></p> <p>
你将会需要： TNT、 铁门，压力板或是按钮，箱子或者钻石块。</p>
<p>
用不会被tnt破坏的方块建造一间房屋，然后用TNT填覆盖它，再在外面用另一种材料建造一层，这差不多就完成了，只在房屋的入口处放置两个铁门和石制压力板或者按钮，再在其旁边放置一个TNT。放置一个清晰可见的箱子或者钻石块在屋子里来诱惑他人。 当有人见到那个箱子，他们会试图进入这个房子，当他们踩上压力板事时，就会触发TNT，是受害人卡在房子里，然后死于爆炸。 如果希望更好的效果，可以用冰或者灵魂沙制造一个"门垫"以减缓敌人的逃跑。
</p>
 <p>  <b>Simple capture trap - the concept of imprisonment
</b></p> <p>
First, make a long passage that is 2 blocks high, 1 block wide and five or more blocks long that should be in a cave. Fill it in at the end, so your target player should mistake it for a mine/dungeon. In the middle, place a pressure plate and redstone on both sides. The blocks on either sides shouldn't be obsidian. Under the block of choice, should be a piston (sticky if you want to use it again). Then place a tempting sign on the end of the passage that says "Diamond Mine" or "Danger: Do Not Enter". People can't resist what's bad for them, after all. The target should go in, step on the pressure plate, and get trapped when the entrance/exit becomes 1 by 1 and too small for the player or mob to get out of. Check it every now and then and if there is a player/mob stuck in there, shoot with a bow or put lava in it. If you want to use it again, remove the lava, and put a lever next to the pushed up block and pull it. This only works with sticky pistons, so be warned. Now, claim your loot and walk away. If you want to prevent tunneling, place lava behind the wall. Or after the subject has been trapped, they could be pushed using water into a lava pit.
</p>
 <p>  <b>贪婪骗局 - 欺骗贪婪者
</b></p> <p>
挖一个24方块深的洞，放一些可以杀人的装置在底部，如：仙人掌，生物，岩浆，活塞陷阱等等，在顶端放置一个方块，然后在上面放置一个牌子，写上“下面有钻石/绿宝石 ”然后当你的受害人破坏了方块然后就会掉下去。 注意：这个陷阱有些明显，特别是放了那个不靠谱的注释以后，这很可能不会在老有经验的玩家身上起作用，另外不要忘记在底部放置杀人装置，因为你的受害人可能穿着摔落保护的靴子……哦，你好像有麻烦了！
</p>


 <p>  <b>贪婪骗局2.0
</b></p> <p>完成上面的操作，再附加一个压力板和至少10个TNT。</p>

 <p>  <b>地狱之车 - 创造一个虚假的安全感
</b></p> <p>Create a 24 blocks or higher tower and create a room at the top. Put stairs to the room on the tower. Make a hole 1x1 at the bottom. Put some rails that end at the hole. Make a simple house beneath the tower. Put a hole on the roof. Remember, the hole on the tower must be right above the roof hole on the house. Put a block then a powered rail beneath the roof hole. Make a tunnel with normal rails and break one of the rails. Now, go to the tower and put a minecart on the rail. Push that cart to hole and the cart falls to the house tunnel on the powered rail. Put a button and redstone wire connecting to the powered rail. Wait until someone goes inside your house, looking for a hidden mine or a chest. The uninvited guest will ride the minecart and push the button. The cart will keep moving until the unconnected rails and surprise, he/she died with no reason as the minecart stops. Another way to kill griefers with minecarts is by making a rail to a simple wooden house, where the chest is easily seen from the tracks. Then put a detector rail in front of the door. Put redstone leading from the detector rail to the door. The griefer will think it opens the door. Put TNT under the block the redstone is on. When the griefer in the minecart goes over the detector rail at the end of the rail in front of the house, the redstone will get powered activating the TNT below, this will blow up your unwelcome guest.
</p>
 <p>  <b>TNT矿车炸弹
</b></p> <p>If you want to add some more power to a TNT trap, try replacing the TNT with a lot of TNT Minecarts. Since you can easily condense them down into a small space, it can be good when you need to make a design more compact. You can either choose to put them on an activator rail, or to put a piston beside the rail. I prefer the second option, because disturbing a cluster of TNT Minecarts will often cause them to detonate instantly!
</p>
 <p>  <b>一个“粘糊糊”的情况 - 奇怪的陷阱力学
</b></p> 
<p>你将需要(此为一个陷阱所需的数量，你可能需要更多来得到更好的效果):</p>
<ul>
    <li>灵魂沙15个</li>
</ul>

<p>First, make a 1x3 hole in the ground. On the edge, build 3 blocks high (later you will destroy these). Now make an outline of it, but on the level you just created. If you are on a flying server, you might want to add a roof, which is an extra 3 to 12 blocks of Soul Sand. When your trap is complete, human-sized mobs - such as zombies and skeletons - or other people will walk into your trap and can't walk out. Also, if you place ice under the soul sand, mobs and people will move even slower due to the properties of ice.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Griefer bait trap - the concept of temptation
</b></p> 
<p>You will need: Enough wood planks to make a box home, a sign, a pressure plate, a wooden door, and as much TNT as you want. This trap works best on PVP/griefing servers. Make a box home from planks, with a door and a pressure plate outside. Under the pressure plate, put as much TNT as you wish. Place a sign outside that says something like "please don't grief my home thx." Griefers or robbers can't stand not griefing a house like this. They will probably walk through the door, trigger the TNT, and blow themselves to the moon! Using trapped chests are also good, if they cannot identify the difference between the normal chests and trapped chests.
</p>
 <p>  <b>画 - 背叛
</b></p> 
<p>这是一个非常容易建造的一种陷阱，只需要2-3个羊毛，和一些木头，加上一把镐和铲。Everyone knows the old secret passage behind the painting, this plays on that.
To create make a very deep hole coming off of the side of your house, then put two signs at the end of the hallway leading to the hole. Proceed to place paintings on the signs, so when someone walks through the painting, they fall to their death.
It should look like this,<br/>
|-painting, $-告示板，a-空气，b-方块。
</p>
<pre> |$a
 |$a
bbaa
bbaa
bbaa
</pre>
<p>At the bottom have some means of collecting items.<br/>
You can either have a 24 or so block fall, or any other method of killing the intruder.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Evil clay - the concept of innocence
</b></p> 
<p>This is by far one of the most simple traps possible. Clay is recommended for this trap due to the fact that it drops 4 clay balls and is easily broken. An Ender Chest has twice the drops and thus twice the certainty that this will work, but requires a pickaxe, can be seen through and around, and isn't something that somebody would want to break anyways. Any block will work, but, again, clay is the best. This trap is placed inside the bottom of a wall. Dig back 2 blocks into the bottom of the wall. Then, dig down to make it a 2x2 square of air. Now, place redstone wire in the corner farthest from the hole that you're working through. Place a wooden pressure plate in front of it. The plate MUST be wooden. Stone can't sense items at all, and iron and gold pressure plates emit too weak of a signal and are too expensive if you plan on doing this in Survival. Above the wire, place a Dispenser facing towards the hole, loaded with a projectile, Potion Of Harming (II) or suitable spawn egg (the inventor of this trap uses Blazes). Finally, the time comes for the clay! Place the clay in the last remaining spot in the hole. The trap, completed, should look like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing2.png" />
<br />
</p>

<p>This is a useful trap on adventure maps, especially when clay is a chosen breakable block. (An example of this trap on an adventure map would be in the Tunnels of Insane Trickery in the map Eitharpius.) This trap is activated when the clay is broken.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Facebreaker trap - the concept of obscure damage
</b></p> 
<p>What you need: Five blocks of any kind, and as many gravel blocks as possible.
</p>
<p>This is one of the most simple traps in Minecraft history, although it would be easily noticed by intelligent players. Works more effectively on new players. First, make a tower that is five blocks high. It doesn't matter which kind of block you use. Then, on the very surrounding area on the tower you made, dig holes three blocks deep and three blocks wide to make a pit surrounding your tower. Dig another hole close to your tower, just one block deep for you to hide in. When an unsuspecting target comes too close to the tower, he would fall in the pit. After that place several Gravel blocks beside the 5th block on your tower, aiming downwards on the target. If done correctly, the gravel blocks should fall on your target's head, thus trapping or killing him. Hence the name facebreaker.
</p>
<p>Note: You will need to use atleast two blocks of gravel to kill a player, and this can actually be used as a convenient elevator. Placing more gravel blocks is advised, and it is also advised that you place them quickly. Otherwise, if you take too long, the player may jump up from the first gravel block (their feet will be in it), and not be suffocated by the second.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Burning tree trap - the concept of desperation
</b></p> 
<p>This is a simple trap that can be made without too much work.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build a large wooden rectangle resting on its side. The rectangle must be at least 10 blocks tall or the trap will not be effective.</li>
<li>At the top of the rectangle build a large cobblestone box.</li>
<li>Break a hole in the bottom of box.</li>
<li>Fill this hole with gravel and then build the gravel down to the floor of the wooden box.</li>
<li>Place a chest under the gravel.</li>
<li>Fill the cobblestone box completely with lava.</li>
<li>Add some leaves. make sure it looks just enough like a tree to blend with the forest, but not so much that people will not notice it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The person will be fascinated with the tree and will enter. The person will see the chest, and, thinking there is loot in it, will break the gravel blocks in order to open the chest. As he breaks the gravel blocks, the hole in the box of lava is unplugged, causing lava to flow onto the victim. This will definitely NOT work on experienced players. A diagram of this would be helpful, as it is rather poorly explained.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Obvious "defuse me" landmine - the concept of hiding in plain sight
</b></p> 
<p>You need: A desert and cheats/McEdit To build, place a pressure plate on a large area of sand. Then, edit away a good bit of the stuff under it. On the bottom, place your weapon of choice (such as lava, the Void, an array of standard landmines as shown below, a Charged Creeper dungeon, an End Portal, a jail cell, some other trap, or just a plain floor if the pit is deep enough) and remember where you put it.
</p><p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing3.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing4.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>This trap is obviously quite impossible to create without help. A player wandering around will see a random pressure plate. If they realize that it's a landmine, they'll destroy the plate or a block near it and trigger the pitfall. If not, they might step on it and trigger the pitfall. Or maybe somebody will decide to build a house on your trap, once again setting it off.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This trap can be done without World Edit If you know the right method- the fact that lilypads can help place sand/gravel in midair if you know how. Also, you could use torches and multiple layers of sand and wooden pressure plates to cause a 'sinkhole' effect that is similar (although much slower).
</p>
 <p>  <b>Spring trap
</b></p> 
<p>Requires: 1 pressure plate 1 slime block 1 piston
</p><p>This trap relies on fall damage to damage the enemy. and must be remade every use. NOTE. does not work on Chickens Ocelots or Magma cubes
</p><p>Not sure why you would kill Ocelots though.

</p>

 <p>  <b>Don't run - The concept of curiosity killing the cat</b></p> 
<p>This is a very easy trap to build. Go into a cave and dig at least 36 blocks down. Dig a 4 block deep pit and put water in its second topmost layer. Have blue wool, signs/ladders, a pickaxe and a chest ready. Also build what looks like an entrance to a base at the bottom of the trap. Now get a player and tell him that he's found someone's secret base. Jump into the water and quickly submerge yourself in the pit. Put the signs/ladders to give you air bubbles to breathe. Tell the player on top that you'll put water on top of the pit so he and you can escape. Instead of water, use the blue wool to cover up the pit. Signal the player to jump and when you see his death-message, dig your way out and collect all the loot.

<h2>贪婪</h2>

 <p>  <b>死亡之屋
</b></p> 
<p>用任何固体材料制造一间屋子(避免使用防爆炸的材料如黑曜石)， 然后用TNT将房子完全包覆，之后再加上一层方块以遮盖TNT。 在入口放置两扇铁门和石质压力板，在压力板下的方块置放TNT，然后在房子里放上一个明显能看得到的箱子以吸引尝试进入的玩家。 当他们踩到压力版并且进入房子后，就会引爆TNT!
注：部分服务器不允许玩家置放TNT，不要太过期望他们会在短时间内允许你。</p>

<p>可行性：新手<br/>
建议：<br/>
把房子建造得更像在野外生存的废弃临时避难所，需要有床、工作台、火把以及箱子。地点也要适中，最好是在深山里。也方便你躲在树后观察受害者。
</p>

 <p>  <b>贪心人的坟墓
</b></p> 
<p>你需要：<br/>
钻石盔甲 (全套\附魔为佳)，<br/>
钻石块或钻石矿石(通过精准采集获得)，<br/>
锹(任何一种)，<br/>
镐(任何一种)，<br/>
钻石剑(附魔为佳)，<br/>
地狱岩，<br/>
打火石，<br/>
火把<br/>
可选：更多的钻石块或钻石矿石。<br/></p>

<p>挖一个三层深的洞，洞外用地狱岩包围起来，点上火，跳进去洞里，用钻石块把洞口封起来。然后继续往下挖，直到至少24层深为止(跌死的最低限度)
</p><p>当有人站在钻石块上并且采集它，他就会跌进洞里并且爆装，这时你就可以收集他的物品并且收回你的钻石快来重新设定陷阱。</p>

<p>假设跌落的玩家有穿盔甲，跌落后以最快的速度杀死他。要注意的是他复活后很有可能找来他的朋友或者是利用某些方法来杀死你(往洞口倒水、熔岩、丢炸弹等。
</p>
<p>你可以放置更多的钻石块，或者是在山洞里使用钻石矿石安装这个陷阱，让更多人上当。</p>

<p>可行度：新手，专门对付过于贪婪、做事前不三思的玩家。</p>
<p>建议：在天然洞穴中安装这个陷阱能使效果倍增，不过就不必放置地狱岩了，可以使用火把来标记出钻石，这看起来像是某玩家的标记，让人更容易上当。当然，稍微有经验的玩家会先挖开钻石矿石附近的方块，这时陷阱就暴露了。
</p>
 <p>  <b>假矿石陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>你需要：大量TNT、一个像废弃矿井的结构、绊线钩、铁门，还有一些红石。
</p>
<p>准备：<br/>
1. 把TNT放在玩家将要站立的那层的下面。<br/>
2. 在玩家进入的地方放上铁门。<br/>
3.将绊线钩连接TNT，但要保证绊线钩在铁门旁边。<br/>
4. 在铁门上放一个告示牌，上面写“xxx的钻石矿井，请勿进入”。<br/>
5.等待别的玩家上钩。<br/>
</p>
<p>陷阱的执行<br/>
1. 受害者看到了你的矿井，想可能有钻石或其他矿在里面。<br/>
2. 受害者看到绊线钩，认为这是用来开门的。<br/>
3. 受害者踩上绊线，激活TNT，然后归西。<br/>
</p>
 <p>  <b>廉价贪婪陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>所需材料：箱子、TNT、压力板和红石(可选)。
</p>
<p>在一个由石头或泥土制成,高两个方块的长通道的尽头放置一个箱子。在箱子前,挖一个一个方块宽两个方块深的洞。在底部放置一个TNT方块,在其上放置一个看上去平常的方块,以及最后放置一个压力板在上面。你可以根据通道的长度在地底放置更多TNT(但是一定要将它们全部难以觉察地覆盖,因为当玩家听到了TNT点燃他们可能会往回跑)。无论是谁踩在空箱子前面都会点燃TNT。你会需要在每次点火之后重建整个陷阱。以更多的资源为代价来确保死亡,在所有TNT下放置红石线,以便让它们立即点燃。
</p>
 <p>  <b>好奇陷阱

<br />完成图
</p>

<p>注：红色羊毛表示熔岩，注意TNT的放置位置，其实五边都要放(门的左上、左下、右上、右下、和脚下)。
</p>
<p>可行性：高级。除非是有遇过或者是看过陷阱制作篇的玩家，不然进入后都无法幸免。
</p>
<p>建议：使用红石电路，在玩家踩下压力板开门后，红石触发计时器，让活塞在玩家进入后在门口上方打开一个洞口，让熔岩留下来，这样就能避免玩家在打破铁门后迅速逃离现场。
</p>
 <p>  <b>贪婪铁轨
</b></p> 
<p>制作一段长充能铁轨,充能除了第一块以外的所有。放置一辆矿车以及一个开关在第一块铁轨上来让车子移动。放置一块写着"(你的名字)的钻石矿坑,严禁进入"的告示牌在旁边。
</p>
<p>然后建造一段在顶端有一段急下降的长上坡轨道。在矿车落下的地方,做一个4x4,深两个方块的洞然后用熔岩填充它, 以便让玩家忽然落入熔岩然后失去他们所有的物品。你可以用稍后用一个桶来拜托熔岩。 注意:确保熔岩在下降前不可见来避免玩家跳出来。
</p>
<p>另一个方法是制作一个向下的长隧道,用一般铁轨,以及当轨道转过一个角,放置熔岩。 最好你有火把沿着隧道这样那人不会察觉到即将发生什么。
</p>

 <p>  <b>邪恶矿石</b></p> 
<p>
超级简单的陷阱，不过却非常有效。
放置一个原矿石，如铁矿石。在它后面插一根红石火把，在另外一个石头上也放置一根红石火把，使用红石线链接它们。在另一个红石火把处放置大量TNT、发射器或者任何机关都可以。这不单是一个简单的陷阱，也非常容易制造。如果连接高频的时钟电路再连接输入“移动被暗算者至某处”的命令方块的话，你甚至可以判处被暗算者无期徒刑！

 <p>  <b>Simple ore trap
</b></p> 
<p>A very easy, cheap, but effective trap. Put iron or other ore anywhere. Place a redstone torch on back. Now, place another redstone torch, on the side of a block. Put wires connecting the torch to the top of that block. Make it activate any kind of killing mechanism, such as retracting pistons.

<p>  There is another trap that you put water 4x4 three blocks down then lilypads on top ,place sand on the lilypads and string on the sand then place any block where the water is so it is being replaced by the block then break the replaced block and vōila when a player walks on the string or breaks the string they fall end of story .
</p>

 <p>  <b>Fiery floor trap
</b></p> 
<p>This is a somewhat expensive trap with varying success rates. The larger the trap, the higher the success rate. First, dig a hole two blocks deep (size doesn't matter but does affect price). Next, cover the bottom of the hole with Dispensers, leaving a one block area on each edge to be filled with two blocks of your choice. Place a chest or Diamond Block on top of one of these stacks. This will serve as bait. Leave the other space filled, but do nothing else to it. Fill each Dispenser with Fire Charges and cover with Wood Planks or Stone and then cover the solid block with a Wood or Stone Pressure Plate depending on which block you used. Next, build a wall around the now-covered hole and place an Iron Door opposite from the bait with a Wooden Pressure Plate in front of it. Leave the block behind the door uncovered. A roof is recommended but not required. When an enemy enters the trap, they will go for the bait and walk on the Pressure Plates, activating the dispensers underneath, which will launch Fire Charges at them. The victim will be unable to leave due to the absence of a pressure plate to open the door from inside. You can also, with this same concept, create an extremely effective mob trap. place a 3 by 3 square of pressure plates. Connect these via redstone to three dispensers filled with fire charges. Then all you have to do is build a shelter and watch the fun. Note: this trap relies on huge amounts of luck and is very expensive. Also, take care when retrieving the mob drops, as it is easy to fall victim to your own trap.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Pond of death
</b></p> 
<p>You will need: wood pressure plates, water buckets and TNT.
</p>
<p>First, dig a 9x9 hole (size varies) that is 4 blocks deep. Then, place TNT on the bottom, place some blocks on top of the TNT, place the pressure plates and apply water. Voila!
</p>
<p>Execution of trap: 1. Victim will see trap. 2. Victim will fish, causing the plates to be triggered. 3. Victim will be blown up.
</p>
 <p>  <b>The exploding diamond</b></p> 

<p>Yes, this trap is the mother lode. Once they break the diamond, it will explode almost instantly, unlike any other TNT trap (when TNT ignites, it will have a 4 second cooldown timer). This will guaranteed it will grief players and see their bloody guts splattered on the walls of the crater.
</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>

<li>A lever</li>
<li>9 Minecarts with TNT</li>
<li>A piece of redstone</li>
<li>A diamond block</li>
<li>A Dispenser</li>
Flint and steel</li>
<li>A redstone torch</li>
<li>A rail</li>
</ul>
<p> Here's what the trap will look like on the side:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing6.png" />
<br />
</p>

<p> First, dig a hole three blocks deep and 6x1 blocks wide. Look at the picture above to help you see what it is look like. Place a diamond block on top of the hole so it is covering it, but sticking out. You must place the lever underneath the diamond block and switch it on. Place a block 1 block below the lever and place redstone on top of the block. Place a redstone torch on the side of the block. It should turn off when placed. After that, place a dispenser facing the direction of the torch and put flint and steel inside it. Then, place a rail next to the face of the dispenser and place 9 Minecarts with TNT onto the rail. Carefully break the rail and your trap is done! When someone tries to mine the diamond block, they will get an explosive surprise!
</p>
<h2>爆炸性陷阱</h2>
<p> A good idea when testing Explosive Traps is to use a block such as a Redstone Lamp, which, like TNT, triggers with Redstone Power, but has less explosive results, so you don't lose an intricate trap due to careless TNT ignition.
</p>


 <p>  <b>Anti-Tunnel Mine
</b></p> 
<p> People are coming through a tunnel below you. They are equipped with enchanted weapons, and you're alone, so you don't want to dig down and ambush them. Instead, run quickly to a farther ahead section and set up the trap. Dig into the tunnel. Two blocks high, make a tripwire going into the walls. Remove any torches and replace with redstone torches to render the tripwire string almost invisible. About 5-10 blocks ahead, go back to the surface and stand right above the tunnel. (Or if the tunnel is deep down, dig down to it and stand right above it there.) Make sure the ceiling of the tunnel is dirt, not stone. Place 8/18 TNT blocks on the ceiling dirt in a square pattern that's TWO BLOCKS HIGH, and connect the TOP-SIDE BLOCKS to the tripwire. Cover the TNT with stone so that it doesn't fly away when it ignites. People reach the tripwire and trigger it. They run a few blocks ahead, and suddenly, boom, the ceiling dirt is cut through and TNT with a fuse of 1 slams down on the unfortunate people. Even if they are armored, instant death guaranteed UNLESS they have iron/diamond blast protected armor. For more chance of success, use 18 blocks of TNT instead of 8.
</p>
 <p>  <b>BUDed TNT Traps
</b></p> 

<p> The trick here is to make the TNT BUD-powered, meaning the TNT is being activated by redstone, but the TNT does not realize that it is being powered. You could also create BUD-powered powered rails and create deadly instant explosion traps using TNT minecarts.
</p>

<p>Here is another BUD-powered TNT trap, which uses the "instant explode TNT minecart" concept mentiones in the above text.

 <p>  <b>TNT cannon tree trap (for the rich)
</b></p> 

<p>This trap is guaranteed to catch any Minecrafter unawares. Placing this trap in a very dense forest/jungle will guarantee success. Build a HUGE tripwire (around 25 string wide) and at either end add 2 TNT cannons with 4 charge TNT, 6 repeaters with full delay in repeater terms and a level surface for firing the 'bullet' TNT compared to the charge TNT. Place one TNT cannon right next to the tripwire hook facing in the way of the tripwire, and place the other approx. 7 blocks away from the tripwire hook and optionally add another TNT cannon with the same attributes as the other 2 cannons in the other direction as the one that isn't next to the hook 7 blocks away from this tripwire hooks. Camouflage them all, make sure they have a direct line of fire and you're set to obliterate any griefers that come near your base (if you decide to place it near your base). Finish them off if they survive (60% guarantee they won't!)
</p>
 <p>  <b>SCR-Break Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This trap blows to bits any griefer who tries to destroy your house. Create an SCR and make a line of redstone dust from it to the wall of a room. On the other side of the wall from the redstone, put a redstone torch. (If the redstone torch stays lit for more than 1/10 second, you did it wrong.) Now pack the rest of the room full of TNT, and make sure at least one block of that TNT is touching the torch from the side or top.
</p>
<p>If a griefer walks up to your house, he/she may destroy the SCR, turning on the torch and igniting one block of TNT. This turns into a chain reaction, and unless the griefer has amazing speed, there is no way he/she will get away from the blast radius of the TNT.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Guerrilla Mine
</b></p> 
<p>This is undoubtedly the simplest TNT trap in existence. It requires very little time, and effort, but is obvious to the relatively keen eye. Dig a hole 2 blocks deep into whatever environment you choose, put TNT on the bottom and place a random block on the top. Simply place a pressure plate, and you have an instant land mine. More intricate traps are good for better success ratios, but you can greedily render entire environments inhospitable, or use it as a very cheap mob defense for home security. Remember to always note which planes of land you have laid mines on, or you may fall victim when hunting or exploring. A bunch of fakes can create a false sense of security -- or an ultimatum to leave you alone, if the first ones they trigger are real! <p>  <b>Explosive Furnace trap
</p>

</b></p>  <p>  <b>Explosive Furnace trap
</b></p> 
<p>Normally people would expect chests to explode, so this trap will surprise them as soon as they loot your furnace. To make an explosive furnace, fill a furnace with coal, iron and food (you decide) and place a comparator leading away from the furnace. If its off, you did it wrong. Place a repeater in front of the comparator and then put any block in front of that. Place a redstone torch on the side of the block (not the back) and place a redstone line leading as close to the wall as possible (One block away will do) and put TNT everywhere! The victim will loot the furnace, causing the comparator to deactivate, along with the repeater, then causing the 'NOT gate' to turn the redstone line on, which will activate the TNT, blowing the victim to bits!!!
</p>
 <p>  <b>C4 Trap
</b></p> 
<p>Dubbed so by Bannablarg, the first to use this with success, this "C4" is a vertical or horizontal stack of TNT with a dispenser wired to a button with a fire charge in it. The dispenser is placed one block above or below the stack (vertical) or one block next to the stack (horizontal). This usually works better for demolition than for a trap, if you want that, you can wire a pressure plate to the dispenser. This works similar to a flaming arrow hitting a stack of TNT from above. This is another way to remotely detonate the TNT, via flaming arrow. This works better than a dispenser shooting TNT, because the "C4" stays in one place. Also, if only two TNT blocks are used, it works well as a disposable cannon, even better on obsidian blocks, but not in a tube. All evidence of the trap is usually destroyed. Note: C4 trap from below does not work very well.
</p>

 <p>  <b>TNT Double Trouble</b></p> 
<p>Place a TNT block on any surface 1 block and cover with natural blocks from the biome the trap is set. Underneath the TNT the victim will suppose to find some redstone from a trap and will mine the TNT as bounty. But it turns out the "TNT landmmine" was a fake, and that underneath the landmine was the actual trap! The victim falls onto a pressure plate and notices the real horror, a 3x3x3 room full of TNT connected to the pressure plate he's standing on!
</p>

  <p>  <b>Cheaper version</b></p> 
 <p>Instead of a cave, you can make a 1x24x1 (x y z) tunnel with TNT at the bottom and a block above a pressure plate on cobblestone. This version has the disadvantage of a player having a bucket of water being able to escape and reset the trap/change the layout to kill you!
</p>


 <p>  <b>Fake Mine TNT Trap
</b></p> <p>Dig a hole about four blocks down (one block wide)so it looks like a mine but really isn't. Cover the hole with a trap door and place a sign above that says "Diamond (or gold) mine" Put a metal pressure plate in front of the hole with a block of TNT beneath. A player will think that the pressure plate will open the trap door to the mine, and instead they explode.
</p>

 <p>  <b>The Hidden House
  </b></p> 
  <p>This trap is the opposite of a TNT door trap: The TNT is obvious, while the house is hidden. Make a field of TNT extending about 5 blocks into the ground. Place signs all over the field saying: "Find my hidden house." It lures people in dually: the TNT danger, and the hidden house challenge. The problem is that there is no house! Beneath the field are pressure plates which fire the TNT, leaving no time to escape, as you are in a field of TNT 6 blocks under. Once it's activated, not even flying can help. The only way to survive? Creative.
</p>

 <p>  <b>House of Obliteration
</b></p> 
<p>This trap is obvious... too obvious. It's a house of TNT. It obliterates everything near it: blocks, buildings, mobs, players, you name it. People will go around it and within it because they think it's only activated when someone goes in. To build it, you need to build a cleared out standard house. Then cover the outside with as many layers of TNT as you want. The more layers, the more obliteration and the larger range. Now follow one of these versions:
</p>
<p>Suicide: Least expensive, least efficient. You activate it from the inside by flipping a lever in a hole on the wall. Everything within the range is obliterated, including you.
</p>
<p>Murder: Most expensive, most efficient. Get far away from the house, at least to the point where it's hard to see. Use a redstone circuit to activate it from a distance, obliterating everything within range, but you will live.
</p>
<p>Genocide: Get at least 5 layers of TNT. Go very, very far away. Activate it. Wait for mass obliteration. Return. See the new [Name of Biome] Obliteration Memorial Park. WARNING: Do at a MAXIMUM of once a month to avoid crashes.
</p>
<p>The Man: Build a Player-Sized copy of the character. Surround it in TNT "armor" completely. Attach a redstone circuit to the TNT. Blow it up. Notice: for inconspicuous explosions. Optional: turn it into Mega-Man by repeating the TNT layer many times.
</p><p>Auto-versions (triggered by the victim not the builder): Try putting a metal door on the TNT house. If the player is new or just distracted they'll hit the button to open the metal door, igniting the house.
</p>
<p>Floor triggers are the most popular trigger ever (due to the land mine being the most well known minecraft trap), but the tradeoff is that more people know to watch out for them than any other trigger. Try putting one on the other side of the front door (hoping the door itself blocks the player's sight of it) or around a blind corner in a thin hallway.
</p>
<p>Variation: the "where's the trigger" model. This version counts on the victim carefully looking for a trigger, getting bolder when they find nothing. No "metal door trick", no "easy to see if you're looking for them" triggers on the ground. When they run out of ideas for what to look out for and conclude that it's safe they'll probably loot the house, including the coal from the furnace and the food from the "fridge" (small box beside the furnace). As they pass the table and chairs they hear a click and have 4 seconds to think about how commonplace those makeshift tables have become...to the point that we forget that the top half is a TRIGGER! Note: it can't power downwards through the fence piece but can power sideways. And yes, people do actually fall for this. So many people have grown a blind spot to those tables.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Door of Doom
</b></p> 
<p>放置一个铁门，在地下层的地方制造一个填满TNT的大坑，最后在铁门边放置压力板就完成了。
</p><p>当有人要进入房间时就会被炸飞天。 (If he dies, then put less tnt).
</p> <p>  <b>Exploding bed BUD trap
</b></p> 
<p>VERY simple trap: place a bed next to a BUD switch, connect the output to some TNT, and cover the whole thing in cobblestone, or something like that. then just wait for someone to sleep in it, and watch him/her get blasted sky-high!
</p> <p>  <b>Ocelot Assassin
</b></p> 
<p>Build a medium-sized room (about 10 blocks long and 5 wide) with TNT underneath the floor. Put a pressure plate connected to a dispenser right by the entrance, with an ocelot spawn egg inside. Then put another pressure plate at the far end of the room, connected to the TNT. When the ocelot spawns, it will run away from the player, right on to the pressure plate (hopefully), springing the trap.
</p><p>Note: The downside is you also kill the poor little ocelot. But it was worth it, right?
</p>

 <p>  <b>Land Mine
</b></p> 
<p>最简单的地雷莫过于挖一个1x1深的洞，放置TNT，放置和地表一样的方块，再放置压力板，就完成了。</p>
<p>当有玩家或怪物踩到时，他就会被炸到。(一个不能保证死亡)</p>
<p>
注意：当使用木质压力板时，掉落的物品能触发地雷；另外，此陷阱对玩家没有太大的效果，因为玩家再听到TNT被触发时，还有延迟时间能闪避爆炸，用走的就能在TNT引爆之前离开爆炸范围。解决办法是把一个有火焰弹的发射器连接到压力板+放个TNT矿车在发射器的前面(可以加额外TNT)，然后玩家就必死无疑了！
</p><p>
另外，在沙漠的地雷能发挥沙子的自然掉落性质。在安置好地雷后，把TNT下方挖空，那么一旦TNT被触发时，沙子就会落下，幸运的话受害者还会一起落下。如果你有一间飘浮的房子或者桥，你可以使用同样方法来安装地雷，沙砾也能使用。当受害者踩到地雷时，他会落下并且受伤/死亡，假设他没死，TNT会帮你炸死他。
</p><p>
为了增加地雷的可信性，可以使用骨粉催生附近的杂草，使到地雷难以被发现。也可以放置在山坡处，这样玩家就会不知觉地踩上地雷、或者是放在树的后面。

 <p>  <b>The Chest Bomber
</b></p> <p>
You will need: TNT, redstone, pressure plate, ender chest/chest/trapped chest, sign, block of grass, iron door
</p><p>
Dig a 4 block deep hole in the ground and put 3 stacked TNT in it. Cover it up with a grass block. Put a chest somewhere near the TNT. Place a sign near the chest saying "Diamonds and Emeralds inside!" Don't put anything inside it though. Find the spot where you placed the TNT. Then dig a 2 block deep, 3 block long hole. Put a pressure plate right next to the hole and put redstone leading from the pressure plate to the TNT's. Now build a grass house surrounding the chest and put an iron door that they will "enter." Wait for someone to come along and have them step on the pressure plate and they'll be blown up!
</p>
 <p>  <b>捕获的地雷
</b></p> 

<p>这是针对熊孩子比其他玩家好奇心更重而设计的陷阱，挖一个3×3×4的坑，黑曜石是2、3、4层的墙壁，中间四块左右增加门(门是熊孩子陷阱的内部，TNT向下计数)最后在中心加2个TNT，盖上压板。在石花花和石压板走廊获得最好的结果是。

 <p>  <b>改良地雷
</b></p> <p>
先挖一个5x5,4个方块深的坑。然后将边和底填上黑曜石,但不要填顶上一圈,否则别人会看见。你应该会剩下一个3x3x3的洞。放置两层TNT然后用一层适合环境的方块覆盖。最后加块石制压力板在任何一个TNT方块上。
</p>
 <p>  <b>火矢
</b></p> <p>
这个陷阱将会给一个不幸的玩家来一场火矢雨。 首先，做一个带有熔岩墙壁的长走廊，让熔岩墙壁看起来像装饰品 接下来放置压力板，按钮，拉杆，或者是其他你想用来激活的装置，把它连接到一个脉冲发生器上去。接着把它连接到一排放满了箭的发射器上去(发射器在熔岩后面，这样可以点燃箭形成火矢)。一旦玩家激活了这个陷阱，他们就在这燃烧的箭矢中洗淋浴吧！

你需要的材料：TNT、两个红石火把、沙子或沙砾(可选)，任何种类的矿石或石头。</p>
<p>
在矿石的后面方置红石火把。 放一块就在它的上方，它基于火把。另一个在红石火把。然后围绕顶部火把TNT。 警告：不要低于顶火把或TNT将掀起。 掩盖矿石，等待有人来我这！

 <p>  <b>遥控炸弹
</b></p> <p>
译自：Remote Explosion】 制造一个远程遥控炸弹是可能的，只需要使用鱼竿和木质压力板就行了，将鱼竿抛向木质压力板就能触发炸弹。不过这个方法比较不稳定，因为掉落物能触发木质压力板。

 <p>  <b>陷阱地雷
</b></p> <p>
不同于地雷和改进的地雷，地雷陷阱坑害怪物或玩家时，TNT有足够的时间爆炸。<BR> 首先，挖下四块。接下来，把受重力影响的块(沙砾或沙)放在TNT上，把压力板放在沙上。你也可以把水放在底部的孔。 请注意，这个陷阱的很少对玩家有效，因为他们最有可能避免压力板。为了获得最大的效果，建议你把陷阱在门前，他们通常都是成对便于开启压力板。 注意：这个陷阱是有效是因为进入的生物在TNT的打击几乎是不可能生还的。
</p>
   <p>  <b>爆炸与燃烧
</b></p> <p>
熊孩子喜欢炸掉或烧掉别人的房子。为了阻止这发生在你身上,用木头或羊毛(最好是羊毛)做一间假屋子然后用木头、圆石,或泥土来填充箱子,甚至用煤,使屋子看上去像真的。不要将它们完全填满。将其下的区域填满TNT然后用TNT制作一些延伸出屋外的"辐条"。
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing10.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>注意:制作比图示更多的辐条。</p>
<p>
当屋子被烧毁,里面的TNT会引爆外面的TNT飞向熊孩子。甚至当熊孩子以为他在一个安全的足够远的距离之外,他会被炸向外面的TNT炸死,所以你的假屋会与他同归于尽。
</p> <p>  <b>水下避难所
</b></p> 
<p>注：仅能用于多人游戏！ 首先，造一个水下避难所，并在里面放一些较为珍贵的东西(如钻石、附魔防具等)。然后，挖一个能通到避难所、地面或另一个安全区的隧道。然后，藏在里面并说：“我迷路了！现在谁都可以拥有它。”当有人进入时，在避难所下面点燃一个TNT并马上沿先前挖好的隧道逃出。理想的陷阱不能被外部因素激活(比如别人点燃了TNT或者拉下开关)，这样做会使这个陷阱有点意义，因为有人会等你离线之后再去偷你的战利品。
</p>
 <p>  <b>报警隧道
</b></p> 
<p>建立一个隧道通往门与杆附近。将压力板和熔岩，活板门水，或根据他们的火。当一个玩家拉杠杆打开门，门打开而不是陷阱。令人烦恼的是，铁门无法打开，压力板毫无意义，如果你想要的，讨厌的音乐可以在注释块。防洪墙的熔岩更有趣。
</p>
 <p>  <b>燃烧的陷阱
</b></p> 
<p>建立一个小型的庇护所，外墙用石头搭室内却用木头(不过，不要把石头搭在屋顶上，因为你就要躲在这里)。使用铁大门作为的防护和电线从屋顶可以是关闭。加载车顶与TNT(越多越好，对吧？)。当玩家走，顶上带开关关闭的门。光房顶着火，然后点燃TNT。跑去享受屠杀。
</p>


 <p>  <b>简单的矿井
</b></p> 
<p>这是一个非常简单的陷阱，虽然它是致命的。挖至少5块方块，然后填补了TNT直到有四块的顶部。把一块TNT两块以上，然后把碎石或沙子上然后压板。然后，当熊孩子或其它玩家走过压力板，他们将陷入这个陷阱并被炸死。
</p>
 <p>  <b>邻近感应炸弹
</b></p> <p>
邻近感应炸弹通过探测器感应到玩家来激活TNT,当玩家靠近时，他会自毁并在周围形成大量爆炸，当然，探测器和TNT要隐蔽好，别被发现。
</p><p>
也可以利用刷怪箱的靠近特性，使用一个狭小的空间，然后在里处放一个刷怪箱，最好刷洞穴蜘蛛/蠹虫，只有这些敌人能够通过1×1×1的空间。当那些菜鸟发觉的时候，已经晚了。
</p>
 <p>  <b>挖方块陷阱
</b></p> <p>
这种陷阱当玩家挖掉该方块后被激活。方块上的红石火把随之掉落触发一个非门，第二段红石线被激活，导致TNT被点燃。
</p><p>
这种陷阱的一个优点是，触发它并不需要激活压力板或拉杆等(当只有一个玩家时)。它也很易于制作，因为你可以在地图上对多个方块布线。在不同位置，应使用同一种方块。在洞穴里可以用矿石，沙漠里可以使用暴露的矿石(就像是沙子下降使它裸露在外),玩家建立的城市里可以使用稀有的方块，如钻石块或金块。
</p><p>
你可以用活塞而不是非门来把TNT激活，这种方法的优点是被困住的方块自身不需被布线。

 <p>  <b>闭塞粘性陷阱
</b></p> <p>
如果你的目标成功激活了这个陷阱，他无异于被禁止做任何行动。陷阱包括任何开关(压力板可能是最好的一个选择)和两个粘性活塞。在激活活塞开始反复运作后，目标会在他们之间移动。这使目标移动很快，即使他/她有一个钻石镐也无法挣脱。确保你给予目标的空间是封闭的，以及你所用的材料硬度足够高，但注意活塞不能移动黑曜石或基岩。 注：不确定是否你可以用附魔了挖掘效率的钻石镐摆脱一个石头制成的闭塞粘性陷阱。
</p>

 <p>  <b>粘性活塞陷阱
</b></p> <p>
这个陷阱和门陷阱很相似, 除了看不见之外. 这个陷阱设计需要9个粘性活塞, 1个压力板,一个在压力板上的方块。这样受害者就不能逃走 (对于鸡，史莱姆，岩浆怪或者蠹虫，是一格高。对于爬行者，玩家，村民，骷髅，僵尸或僵尸猪人，是两格高，如果对于铁傀儡或魔影人，是三格高)还要4个方块来隐藏这些粘性活塞。往下挖一格，放上压力板。再在周围四边分别挖两格深的坑，在坑里放上4个向上的粘性活塞。 在每一个活塞的上面放上4个可以被推动的方块。我们建议使用与环境相似的方块来提高隐蔽性。 你也可以建立起一个一长串的粘性活塞陷阱来形成一个保护你的屏障。
</p><p>
提示：绝对不要使用沙子或沙砾或被重力影响的方块作为被活塞推动的方块，另外，专家建议在对付骷髅的时候请一定小心，(如果被屋顶遮住阳光，他们可以从陷阱里面射箭)，以及爬行者(他们可以在你靠近的时候爆炸)也可以制作一个高频红石，配合连接上装满箭的发射器的与门。

 <p>  <b>活塞TNT陷阱
</b></p> <p>
此陷阱是1×2的过道, 或许可以放在你仇人的矿道里. 放置一个压力板, 当那个可怜的家伙站到上面的时候， 两个活塞被触发，挡住了那个快乐矿工的去路,接着TNT被触发，然后就没有然后了！
</p>
 <p>  <b>活塞TNT陷阱2
</b></p> <p>
这个陷阱主要运用于生物(或者你那傻傻的朋友)，他工作的方式和活塞陷阱的方式差不多，但这只是告诉你最简单的方法。提醒一下，视频中的方式其实是不可使用的，因为玩家可以径直穿过正在引爆的TNT，所以为了让他恢复使用，必须要在地面上放置一个方块来盖住活塞和TNT。

 <p>  <b>Piston TNT Trap 3
</b></p> <p>
You will need: 36 TNT, 36 Pistons, 36 Dispensers and 36 flint and steel, 5 Pressure Plates (so the pistons don't turn off almost instantly), Lots of Redstone 1 Lever, 1 chest with nothing in it and some cobblestone. First make a 3 block high wall out of cobblestone nine blocks long and 6 blocks wide. Now place the chest at the end of the hallway the player will think there is loot in it. Next build a roof on it. Line the 2nd row with pistons, then place TNT on the Pistons. Now place the pressure plates somewhere in the hallway (they all have to be next to each other)and connect it with the pistons. Make sure to put the lever half way down the connection. Now flick the lever and turn the pistons on. Above where the TNT Blocks are now place the dispensers and connect them to the pressure plates. Now flick the lever back and turn the pistons off. Now put 1 Flint and Steel in the dispensers. Now wait or your unfortunate victim to walk into the trap.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Anti-Griefing Defense Trap
</b></p> <p>
This trap consists of many different traps that you can find on the page. You will need: lots of TNT, Lots of Redstone, Lots of Stone Pressure Plates, 5 Levers, 50 Dispensers, 5 minecarts with TNT, Lots of Arrows, 45 Lava Buckets, Lots of Cacti, Lots of Netherrack, Flint and Steel. First make 5 instant landmines. If you want you can connect all the landmines with redstone for mass explosion or you can manually control them with a lever. Next make a long corridor 22x5x2. Now line the 2nd row with dispensers and fill them with arrows. Then place lava over them. Next place a pressure plate in the middle of the hallway. Now place a 3 block high cacti wall (it has to be on sand). They can't be side by side so dig a 1x1 hole and place netherrack in it and light it on fire, repeat this stage to make a large wall around your land. All these traps combined will make an awesome defense against griefers
</p>
 <p>  <b>Roof TNT Trap
</b></p> <p>
A 'Roof TNT Trap' can be made by putting a pressure plate next to a door then wiring that pressure plate to activate TNT hidden in the ceiling. This works best in a small area such as a mine. To limit the space the target can run, use an iron door and only place the pressure plate on the outside. To further limit the space the target can run, have the pressure plate also wired to an inverted piston that drop gravels, blocking the remainder of the tunnel.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Mined Ore Trap
</b></p> 
<p><b>Note: The double door glitch only works in older versions!</b>
Very simple. Use the double door bug so one of the iron doors stays open and then put a pressure plate inside a room. Then mine a block out of the wall and place lava 2 blocks back and seal it up with some ore, so when people mine the ore, the lava comes out and they can't escape because when they try to exit the iron door closes.
Here is an overhead view: X= wall D= door P= Pressure Plate O= Ore L=Lava

 <p>  <b>Simple version (a different author to door pitfall)
</b></p> 
<p>This trap is very simple. In front of the door you want to dig down a 1 by 1 hole as far down as you want. Make your pit as close to the door as possible, and be sure to dig it from the same side of the door as you. Once your pit is done, return to the surface. Place a TNT block 2 blocks down in the pit. Place a sand or gravel block on top. Then put a STONE (this way it can only be triggered by players and mobs) pressure plate on the sand/gravel. When a player or mob steps on the pressure plate the delay between the pressure and the door opening will be just long enough for the TNT to activate, causing the player or mob to fall to their deaths. Notes: The delay will only help if there is NO gap whatsoever in between the pressure plate and the door. Optional: Place lava at the bottom of the pit so players aren't motivated to come back for their drops (make sure lava is placed more than one block from the bottom so it isn't smothered by the sand/gravel). 
</p>
<p>  <b>Simple version (a different author to door pitfall)</b>
</p>
   <p>  <b>Door Pitfall
  </b></p> 
  <p>Dig a 1x1 pit in front of an iron door (at least 24 blocks deep).Place a piston (not a sticky piston) on either side of the pit and leave the other side empty.Place a block over the top of the pit and put a stone pressure plate on that block. Then build your house around it.
</p>
 <p>  <b>What happens
</b></p> 
<ol>
     <li>

Someone steps on the pressure plate. Door opens. </li>
<li>The piston extends, breaking the pressure plate. Door closes instantly. </li>
<li>The piston loses power, leaving a hole under the victim's feet. </li>
<li>They fall and die. 5.You get loot!</li>
</ol>

 <p>  <b>Door Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This is a very simple and also rather obvious trap that is made by putting a pressure plate in the middle of 4 open doors so that the victim is trapped inside when they enter, you may also decide to put a block 2 blocks higher than the pressure plate to stop the victim jumping out. This is a very quick and easy to set up trap, making it ideal if you are new to minecraft or simply in a hurry. It is also recommended that the pressure plate is made of stone so that a player can not activate the trap without standing on it, this can be achieved by throwing a block onto a wooden pressure plate. A simple way to make it into a drowning trap is to add a block of water in the block above the pressure plate. When combined with a block on top, the player/mob will drown and not be able to escape. Another way to make this trap more deadly is to place a block of TNT right under the block with the pressure plate on it. Since TNT explodes relatively fast, even if the person manages to get out of the trap quickly, the TNT will probably explode before they have moved a safe distance away. Another fairly simple way is to replace the doors with iron doors and make the top stone and the pressure plate stone and put lava in the middle burning player/mobs making easy to collect their items.
</p>
<p>A modified version of this trap is excellent for curing zombie villiagers. Use wooden doors, replace one door with a 1-high wall, have a block on top, and don't put in a kill mechanism. Once the zombie is trapped, you can administer the cure easily, your patient is protected from the sun, and the cured Villager can exit the trap by themselves.
</p>
<p>If you dig down 2 blocks in the middle, dig a + shape, put water in the 4 sides, place TNT in the middle and cover it up, it'll do damage to the trapped player/mob and not do damage to the land.
</p>
<p>There is another way to do this. You can dig down to the void, place TNT at the 2nd layer, put gravel on top and then a stone pressure plate on top. When the victim goes in, the victim will fall to the void.
</p>
 <p>  <b>TNT Trick trap
</b></p> 
<p>This is very simple. live in the server. Start by making a house made out of Obsidian or any other TNT proof block and put dirt for the floor. under the dirt, Put TNT. On the dirt put a Lever and sign behind it saying: "Pull lever". Hopefully a Noob or someone will come and pull the lever and KABOOM!
</p>
 <p>  <b>TNT Door Trap
</b></p> 
<p>
This is a very simple trap. Start out by building a simple, one story shelter (but don't put in a door yet). Then, go inside the shelter and replace the floor with a two-block deep hole. Cover the bottom of the hole with TNT, then cover the TNT with flooring material. Place valuables inside as needed. Now, exit the shelter and place a pressure plate one block inside the doorway. This plate should be above a block which is above a block of TNT. Place an iron door in the doorway and one pressure plate outside the door. The would-be griefer will step on the outer pressure plate, causing the door to open. When they enter, they will step on the inner pressure plate, thinking nothing of it because it looks like the pressure plate reopens the iron door when they exit. In reality, it's simultaneously triggering the hidden TNT. They'll be blown up while trying to steal your stuff.

 <p>  <b>A Very Simple Trap Door Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This is one of the quickest traps you can make, and does not require many materials. But be warned that it isn't high quality and more intelligent players will quickly disregard it. First, you have to find a place where this trap can be easily concealed, such as a dark doorway or another clever hiding spot. Next, you simply dig a hole about 7 blocks deep, and 1 block wide. Use a bucket to fill the hole 6 or 7 blocks deep with lava. Then, put a wooden trap door on top of it and a pressure plate in front. Players will walk on top of the plate and through the door and fall into the lava. <b>NOTE: This is not a very good trap, but works if you need simplicity.</b>
</p>

 <p>  <b>Fake Entrance Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This is a fairly easy trap to create, but requires a lot of obsidian. Make a fake entrance to your home out of obsidian. It should be 4 x 4 x 9, with six blocks extending underground (4 x 4 pit), and a 2 x 1 space for a door. Hollow out the obsidian (fill the edges of the 4x4 pit), and make an obsidian floor at the bottom of the pit. Then make the 3x3x4 part on the surface. Now go back down, and three spaces from ground level, make a 2 x 2 "floor" out of any material. Use the walls to place it. Two spaces from ground level, make a 2 x 2 array out of TNT. Then at ground level, make a normal floor. On the floor above the TNT, place a pressure plate on three of the spots except the back corner. On this back corner, place a chest. Put a few iron ingots or something somewhat valuable (but not TOO valuable) in the chest. Then, coat the obsidian on the surface with stone or another material. Place an iron door at the front of this material, with the pressure plate positioned so that you cannot leave by way of the other pressure plates inside. If you want to, you can make a sign announcing this is your house. When people walk in, they will not be able to leave, and they must step on a pressure plate to get to the chest, igniting the TNT. They will either blow up or fall to their deaths. It is constructed out of obsidian so it is reusable, but you can make a one-use trap out of any material.

 <p>  <b>Death Chest
</b></p> 
<p>Ingredients: 1 chest, 2 crafting tables, 2 redstone, as much TNT as you want (preferably 10 for mass explosion!), 1 redstone, 2 redstone torches, 1 bucket of water. Place a chest, to the left of it dig down 2 and break a block beneath the chest and place water beneath it to the right. Dig down 2 to the right of that. Dig down another 2 to the right of that. Dig down 3 and place a redstone torch to the front of that. Break 3 blocks and place one redstone to the front of that. Break 2 blocks and place a redstone torch so it turns off. Break 2 to the left of that and place a redstone to the left of that brake the block beneath the top block and place some TNT next to the chest. Place 2 crafting tables, one on each side of it. Then cover all the exposed redstone. 
</p><p>  <b>Door Trap</b>
</p>

 <p>  <b>Door Trap
  </b></p> <p>Requires four iron doors, one pressure plate, and one TNT.
</p>
<p>Place a pressure plate in front of an iron door, and surround the adjacent block with the other doors. Place one TNT with a block on top of it. The player walks, steps on the pressure plate, and traps himself in the door, with the TNT blowing up before they can escape. More TNT can be used to increase power. However, that person could break the iron doors with a pickaxe.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Chest Bomb
</b></p> 
<p>Requires a trapped chest or a regular chest, a hopper, a redstone comparator, a dispenser, and one or more blocks of TNT.
</p>
<p>Place a trapped chest or a regular chest on any surface. Place a hopper underneath and a redstone capacitor right next to it so if you put something in the chest the comparator emits a redstone signal. Put a dispenser wherever the signal leads to, and as much TNT as you want inside. If someone put something inside, they blow up.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Instant Land Mine
</b></p> 
<p>If you are getting annoyed of wasted TNT because people run away from your landmine filled with tons of TNT, you can build a land mine that explodes instantly.
</p><p>
You need:</p><p>
 
1 Flint and Steel<br />
1 Dispenser<br />
1 Pressure Plate (Much better if it is made of stone.)<br />
1 Rail<br />
1 Minecart with TNT<br />

First, dig a 3x3x3 hole in the ground, jump in then stand on a corner. On the bottom center, place a block of dirt then place a rail on top of it. On the rail, place a minecart with TNT (Be careful not to accidentally push the minecart!). Destroy the block under the rail to derail the minecart. The minecart will fall one block lower, this won't really cause any damage unless you accidentally pushed the minecart. Dig the block below you then place a dispenser facing downwards which makes it face the minecart, load the dispenser with flint and steel. Surround the minecart with 8 TNT blocks, after this, surround the dispenser with 8 TNT blocks, too. You should be above ground by now, cover the TNT-filled hole with dirt, remember where the dispenser is. Finally, place a pressure plate on top of the block above the dispenser.
</p><p>
The explosion will instantly kill a player in an armor weaker than a full set of iron armor. If the player is wearing an armor stronger than a full set of iron armor, the explosion will damage the player enough to get killed by falling into the large crater it creates.
</p>
<p>
- Stone pressure plate - 20 TNT - 1 large chest - 1 diamond This should be done in a mine, or somewhere with lots of stone. Place some stone pressure plates in front of a large chest. Put exactly 1 diamond into the chest. Place TNT underneath the pressure plates. Do NOT put a sign. Now go away, and hide. A player may come by, step on the pressure plate(s) hear the TNT, run, and in no time BOOM! They will die.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Housed hell
</b></p> 
<p>make an underground 50X50X10 house. put 2 wooden doors (that door is must be flammable) so someone can enter. add any kind of thing that fishes robbers inside, like diamonds, gold, or diamond blocks and a sign. put a TNT floor then wood floor, but the ceiling and walls must be made from obsidian. make a 1 block hole so lava can enter into the house. put the another wall made from wood, so when the lava touches it will burn. make a gravel trap outside the house and three reversed sticky piston blocks(one in the lava trigger and two in the gravel trigger), that is connected to the stone pressure plate outside. the clock is 30 second long, before the lava flow trigger and 10 second before the gravel trap trigger. (so when the robber entered he thinks it is save to explore inside as he don't see any triggers inside, but when he is done stealing he will trapped in the house, either dying from the explosion, the fire, or the lava)
</p>
 <p>  <b>The back door trap
</b></p> 
<p>Make a wooden house. Double the wooden walls(Optional). Put double iron doors in the front. Put single iron door in the back. In the front put two stone pressure plates in front of the door. <b>NOT IN THE INSIDE</b>.
Now put a pressure plate on the inside for back door. <b>BACK DOOR ONLY</b>. Now put 25 tnt(You can choose) under pressure plate for <b>BACK DOOR</b>. <b>MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE FRONT DOOR PRESSURE PLATES</b>. Now exit safely by breaking the Front door and replacing it. Put some do not enter signs(Optional).
</p><p><b>How it works</b><br/>
1. Player goes in the house.<br/>
2. Player exits out of back door.<br/>
3. They explode.<br/>
</p><p><b>Pros</b>
Might explode to player when far away if built on 1 layer.
You will be able to get the player's items.
</p><p><b>Cons</b>
The player might not exit at the back door.
</p>

 <p>  <b>free (explosive) trees
</b></p> 
<p>All you need are fully mature trees, a lever, redstone, 4 wool, 4 redstone torches, 12 TNT, some fences, and a sign so first you dig a 2 block deep 5 block by 5 block pit (Make sure the tree is in the center) under a tree and break the bottom block. BOTTOM BLOCK ONLY! Then you place redstone under the tree then place four wool blocks around the redstone. After that place 4 redstone torches on the outside of the wool blocks and then place a lever on the under side of the tree and flick it to the on position. Then Place 3 TNT on each corner of your pit and cover it up with a block that matches the terrain and do the same thing to same few other trees. Finally make a fence around your trees and put a sign that says Free Trees.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Land mine
</b></p> 
<p>There are 3 main objects that contribute to making a Land Mine: Primer, Wadding, Explosive. Land Mines are used to injure, or sometimes, kill a target. A single Land Mine is very easy to build, though it usually injures and traps the target. Here's how to make it:
</p><ol>
     <li>

Dig 2 blocks down in the location you want to place the Mine. If a setup is desired that will have a smaller area of effect from the surface, but will not destroy blocks and only damage Mobs, (And of course the player) dig one block further down from there</li>
<li>Place a TNT block. If a setup is wanted that will not destroy blocks, place this TNT in the center of the pit, and a water source at the very bottom</li>
<li>Place a dirt or grass block, or whatever block that would match the environment.</li>
<li>Place a Pressure Plate on the block (from a distance so you don't instantly ignite it).</li>
</ol>


 <p>  <b>Redstone mine</b></p> 
<ol>
     <li>Dig down 2 blocks</li>
<li>Place down a redstone ore (silk touch pickaxe required)</li>
<li>Then place a daylight sensor under the redstone ore</li>
<li>Place as much TNT as you want under the redstone ore connect it using redstone dust</li>
<li>Wait for some one or something to step on the redstone and boom watch what ever set it off explode in to nothing but bone and rotten flesh not very effective on players but a good way to show those pesky creepers how it falls
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Semi-Advanced Traps</h2>
<p> Many traps require some redstone wiring, but these take a significant amount and require a basic understanding of redstone circuitry. Explosive traps, those that use TNT, may destroy sections of redstone wire if the explosion occurs too close.
</p>

 <p>  <b>One time use
</b></p> <p>
This is good if you want to escape a house and make sure nothing follows you. First, make a hidden passage with Redstone. Second, connect the Redstone to a delay circuit and a RS latch's Set input. Third, connect the delayed repeater to the RS latch Reset and connect the RS latch Output to another RS latch or a vertical (optional, for reset) repeater clock that will stay on, also connect the output of the first latch to an And gate. Fourth, connect the Clock or second latch to the and gate with a delay to prevent the And gate from triggering a large TNT charge that is worthy of a self-destruct button (optional ;). Finally, you can add a reset button connected to a piston or Reset input for the Vertical clock or RS latch, respectively. The TNT charge connected to the AND gate output may be as large as you like. For a delayed explosion, make the secret entrance trigger a BUD connected to a furnace.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Water Drop Trap
</b></p> <p>
A trap, designed to trick the victims into thinking that jumping down into water is safe. Kills the victim using fall damage by removing the water source using a dispenser right before the player lands. Not guaranteed to kill if victim has feather falling boots. You can, however, combine this with other traps to guarantee the kill.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Fake Water Drop Trap
</b></p> <p>
A variation of this idea is to have a 1-block drop with "water" at the bottom and a narrow corridor leading off of it, to make it less suspicious. How does it work? Well, a player sees the drop hole and thinks 'Hey, looks like someone's mine!' They fall down the pit and die, because the 'water' at the bottom is actually a lapis block. You are sneaking in the corridor, waiting for the victim to fall! (You might want to have a sword, in case they don't die)

</p>

 <p>  <b>Tripwire Jump Trap
</b></p> <p>
This trap relies on the fact that like end portal, trip wire is invisible from the bottom. Make a room or hallway at least 3 blocks high, and put trip wire in a layer on the third layer up. If the victim jumps, they will trigger the trap. How they are captured or killed is up to the player.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Mob Proof Dispenser Trap (SMP)
</b></p> <p>
This is a fake entrance, and place an iron door with a stone pressure plate on one side, and a button on the inside. Then place dispensers (1-4, make sure nonfatal) in a very obvious location aiming at the door. Then dig a fatal hole on the other side. When the player walks onto the pressure plate, the dispensers should fire. This will push mobs back. In addition, any mobs walking on the pressure plate will attempt to go around as their AI prevents them from falling into the hole. Upon the door closing, they will try to go through the door again, resulting in death. This trap is excellent for SMP servers. Upon seeing the obvious dispensers players will attempt to charge through and end up falling through the hole, where they die.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Arrow Dispenser
</b></p> 
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing16.png" />
<br />An example of a simple setup.
<p>

  This trap is created by attaching a dispenser filled with arrows to a clock generator. When the clock triggers the dispenser, an arrow will fire. The rate of fire is limited by the clock; slower clocks means fewer arrows shot over a given time period. With a rapid pulser, the dispenser will fire roughly 5 APS (arrows per second).
</p>
  <p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing17.png" />
  <br />
A pulsar (blue) and lever (red) attached to a dispenser.
</p>
<p>
Since dispensers don't 'burn out' like torches, it is possible to greatly increase the rate of fire of the dispenser by attaching it to a rapid pulsar. To wire this, connect the rapid pulsar to the dispenser, give the dispenser another power source (such as an adjacent redstone torch). By connecting the rapid pulsar to a stable input (such as a torch controlled by a lever seen to the right), the dispenser can be controlled by turning off the torches in the pulser.
</p><p>
The trap can be automated by attaching a pressure plate to the control torch. When the pressure plate is active, the pulsar is allowed. Arrows shot will roughly reach from 16-24 blocks away from the dispenser.
</p><p>
One way to improve this trap is to place it at the end of a long thin corridor with an iron door entrance. The iron door is opened only from the outside via pressure plate. Have the pressure plate wired to an RS NOR latch so that once activated it will remain active, but can be deactivated by a hidden button.

 <p>  <b>Sticky Piston and Fire Arrow Trap
</b></p> <p>
This trap uses concepts that are described in the "sticky piston and arrow trap," but is only suitable for killing other players, rather than mobs. This trap works by taking advantage of the fact that when a block is mined, and a Redstone torch is attached to the other side, the Redstone torch breaks off. This creates a change in input in order to activate three piston walls, and two rows of dispensers (which are hidden behind two of the walls). The walls that move in this trap serve two functions; two of them reveal rows of dispensers (containing arrows) that may have lava flowing down the front to create fire arrows. The other wall moves in the way that the player came in from to prevent them from running out of the line of fire from the arrows. When the block is mined, the Redstone torch releases a signal that activates these doors. Then, using a logic gate* that is attached to some pulsars (or any other form of clock), the dispensers are activated, firing arrows at the player that activated the trap until dispensers run out of arrows. If the player that activated the trap is wearing projectile protected armor, they will most likely be able to escape the trap. This is why the fire is important for making it more likely they will sustain fatal damage. They may be able to down a fire resistance potion in time, but this is unlikely.
</p><p>
There is a variation of this trap; instead of having three piston walls moving to reveal dispensers and trap the player, you could have the floor open up to a room with dispensers on all four walls, making a much more efficient trap to kill the player. This version of the trap is much simpler to build; however, the former trap is much cooler to see, and may disorient the player more, so that they can't decide what to do to get out.**
</p><p>
It doesn't seem that there exists a name for the logic gate that I used, as I couldn't find it anywhere on the basic Redstone help page.
Standardized diagrams dictating how this works will be available soon!

</p>
<p>
Requirements: 2x Sticky Piston 2x Piston At least 11 Stone Full stack of stone (for hidden version) 2x Painting (for hidden version) Stone Pressure Plate 4x Redstone Torch 2x Redstone Dust Chest or Ender Chest (for greed version) 3 full stacks of stone (for greed version) Torches (for greed version) 1x TNT (for Double Whammy version) Iron Door and another pressure plate (for Double Whammy version)
</p><p>
Standard Version: Create 2 stone pillars (3x1x1) 2 blocks away from each other. Then connect the pillars with another stone block so the player can just barely walk through. Dig down 2 blocks while inside the gate, and then complete a 5x2x1 hole perpendicular to the walk-in direction. Place stone 3 blocks under the block at the top of the gate and place redstone torches on both sides of it. Place redstone dust so the torches power them (on both sides of the stone block with the redstone torches) and then place 2 more stone blocks next to each redstone dust. Next, place redstone torches on these stone blocks and cover them up with 1 stone block each. You can now place a sticky piston on each of these stone blocks so they face the gate. Now, place a pressure plate right in the gate. Dig 1 block down on each side of the pressure plate not occupied by stone and place an upward-facing piston in the open slots. If this is too complex, my video explains this version, but none of the others!
</p><p>
Hidden Version: Start with the Standard Version trap. Duplicate the stone gate (twice) so that there are gates covering both of the pistons, not just the pressure plate. You can now place paintings over the pistons to disguise them (and the trap!)
</p><p>
Greed version: Start with the Hidden Version trap. Duplicate the gates even more to form a long hallway and place your Chest or Ender Chest at the end (contains no loot). Place torches along the sides of the hallway to finish the trap. This can be useful in Multiplayer to trap players.
</p><p>
Double Whammy version: Start with the Hidden Version trap. Duplicate the gates like in the Greed version and light it up with torches. Place an Iron Door and hook up a pressure plate. Place TNT under the pressure plate (people can't see it, trust me!) Place a Chest or Ender Chest (also contains no loot) at the end, so if players manage to escape the TNT, they may be drawn to the Chest/Ender Chest and get suffocated by the pistons!

 <p>  <b>Rapid Pulsar Arrow Dispenser
</b></p> 
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing18.jpg" />
<br />Arrow Dispenser Trap utilizing a stabilized Rapid Pulsar
</p>
<p>
While a standard pulsar will flicker on and off quickly allowing the dispenser to fire rapidly without the manual addition and removal of power, it is often too fast and will cause delays in firing due to the dispenser not being able to keep up. The design on the above diagram compensates for this by slightly slowing the interval between pulses.
</p><p>
It is important to note that in order for the trap to work, the input (I) to the rapid pulsar must be turned ON when the operator does not want the dispenser to be firing. When the power is turned off the circuit will begin pulsing at a steady rapid rate. This allows the arrows to be fired at the quickest rate without delays between shots. A constant power source must also be applied to the dispenser in such a way that it will not conflict with the input of the pulsar to the dispenser. A single redstone torch one block above the dispenser will accomplish this.
</p><p>
This trap works best as a player controlled mob-counter-measure through the use of a switch, as a pressure plate would only send power through the pulsar when a mob is standing on the plate (although a NOT Gate wired to the input before the pulsar could be used to compensate for this).
</p><p>
A subdivision of the rapid pulsar is the Arrow Machine Gun.
</p><p>
First, on a flat surface, mine 1 block down and place a redstone torch. Above it put 2 dispensers. to the left and right of the 1st dispenser, put stone. Then put redstone torches behind (away from the front of the dispensers) the two stone blocks. They must be ON the blocks, not next to them. Put two more stone blocks on the redstone torches, and put redstone torches behind those. After that put two more stone blocks on those redstone torches. Put 2 redstone torches on top of those, and a stone block behind the top dispenser. Finally, put redstone on top of all the uncovered stone blocks. The thing should start to flash. Put arrows in the dispenser, and to turn it off hook up a lever and turn it on.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Undetectable Trap
</b></p> 
<p>
A trap that is based on the fact that you can pick up dropped items through the corner of 2 blocks, which makes the trap undetectable without xray. The dropped item sits on a wooden pressure plate, which is connected to an inverter that holds open a line of sticky pistons that hold the floor. A simple tutorial for this kind of trap can be found here:

 <p>  <b>Lava And Collection Trap
</b></p> <p>
You need one sign, one bucket of lava and two buckets of water.
</p> <p>
Make a trench two blocks wide and put the water flowing down it. Then put the sign at the end on a wall. Put the lava over the sign. Make a glass hut at the end of the trench and wait for the monsters to start rolling in.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Crushing Trap
 </b></p> <p>
 This trap uses pistons to crush skeletons, zombies or players to death. For every square meter you'll need a sticky piston, two cobblestone, and one piece of redstone dust. A lever is also needed to trigger the trap, plus some extra redstone dust.
</p> <p>
Dig the room so the ceiling is 6 blocks high. Place sticky pistons all around so they are facing down at you on the 4th block up. There should be enough space above the piston to walk on it, and enough room on the floor to jump. Replace the ceiling using cobblestone just beneath all of the sticky pistons. The room should now appear to be 2 blocks high, with 2 empty blocks above the pistons (unseen). Using a maintenance shaft, get in the area just above the pistons. Place cobble to cover all the pistons. Cover the top cobble layer with redstone dust. Then, make a trail with redstone dust to a lever. From here you can trigger the ceiling.
</p> <p>
Upon activating the lever, the pistons will push the blocks down and start damaging tall mobs and players. This design can be converted to use pressure plates on the ground to activate the trap rather than a lever. To be effective against spiders and short mobs, lower the entire trap by 1 block, or cover the floor with sticky pistons facing upwards and wire them as well.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Small Crushing Trap
</b></p> <p>
Dig a 3x1 pit 2 blocks deep. Put a pressure plate in one end, redstone in the middle, and any block in the end.
On top of the block opposite to the pressure plate, put a sticky piston facing the plate, and then put some dirt on the piston to hide it.
</p> <p>
Mobs will fall in the hole. If they're 2 blocks tall they'll get crushed, and if they're 1 block tall they'll get trapped!

 <p>  <b>Pit of Doom
</b></p> <p>
Dig a hole that is 2x3. Place two sticky pistons at the end and cover them. Meanwhile, put a pressure plate which is connected to redstone to the pistons. Next, use the /gamemode command to go in creative, place a monster spawner at the bottom of the pit. While you're at it, spawn at least 10 zombies. Once you get out, go back to survival. Target should step on pressure plate, fall into hole, and be mobbed to death by zombies. Cheers!!
</p>
 <p>  <b>Corridor trap
</b></p> <p>
The following Trap uses pistons to suffocate and trap the player. Once the player dies, he cannot get his items back, and if the player does set the trap off, but doesn't get killed by it, he still can't make it past.
</p> <p>
An advantage of this trap is that it can be reset with the press of a button, or completely disabled, if needs be. It is not very obvious - and can simply be disguised as an iron door.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Cave Spider Trap
</b></p> <p>
Actually fairly simple and requires no redstone, but requires a cave spider spawner and iron, coal, or gold.(Diamond could work, but there's no assuring they'll have an iron pickaxe.) Find a cave spider spawner, or hack one in. Surround it in valuables such as coal. Tell others you've found a mine shaft, then "accidentally" give away directions to it. Pretend to feel stupid for giving away directions. Another player will come, then dig the blocks. By then make sure you're not there. The enemy will then get poisoned and bitten until they're dead. An alternate version of this trap would be to either hack in a cave spider spawner or build your house around one, and then to make a dark area where they can spawn but cannot get out. You could then have a piston move a block below the area for them to spawn, and have a pressure plate or button connected that seemingly opens the door to your house. Upon pressing the button/pressure plate, the piston will retract and a cave spider will drop on the player. For added efficiency, it could be placed behind the door in a corridor, making it harder for the player to escape the venomous bite of your arachnid friends.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Suffocating Piston Trap
</b></p> <p>
The following piston trap suffocates the player slowly by filling the room with sand and continuing to fill it until they die or there is no sand left. The player trapped could mine out, or maybe replace the redstone torch(?) Lastly, they could mine enough of the fallen sand that they do not suffocate. Just things a creative player who doesn't panic might try. The following video shows the trap "in motion" and how it's made:

 <p>  <b>Water-Ceiling Shulker Trap</b></p> <p>
The following trap is based on the new shulker mobs introduced in 1.9. Shulkers make you levitate when they hit you with their projectiles. That mechanic is what this trap relies on. The way you make this trap is that you build a large but nooby-looking house. Then, place a hidden shulker turret inside the wall(a shulker that gets pushed out of the wall when it is triggered by something such as tripwire). After that, place water on the ceiling and place signs below so that the house doesn't flood. Finally, put a tempting sign at the entrance so that players will walk in. If a player walks in, the player will be hit by the shulker, levitate into the ceiling and eventually drown. It is better to use lava instead of water if you are trying to defend a factions base. NOTE: If you use lava, you may risk burning the roof.
</p>



<h2>Pitfall</h2><p>
Beware: the following pitfall traps don't necessarily kill the target by falling damage. Some players prefer to use fire, lava, or cactus to deal damage and use the pit as an area the target can't escape before fatal damage has been dealt.
</p>

 <p>  <b>TNT player pitfall trap
</b></p> <p>
Dig a 1×7×1 (2×7×2 recommended) hole, put water on the bottom 2 layers, then put TNT on the second top layer, and sand/gravel on the top layer. Then put a stone pressure plate above, it should look like this:
</p><p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing20.png" />
<br />
</p>

<p>
The player will be stuck in the water until the TNT explodes and kills him. The TNT will also not damage any of the terrain due to the water.
</p>
 <p>  <b>TNT-based pitfall trap
</b></p> <p>
Create a deep 3x3 pit (deep enough so mobs will die upon hitting the bottom). Two blocks down from the surface, place a layer of stone or cobblestone. On top of that, do the same, but make sure the center block is TNT. Finally, place a layer of any block type on top (except TNT, of course). An advantage to stone/cobblestone is that it takes fewer blocks, while an advantage to dirt is that upon the TNT's explosion, it creates a small ledge around the pit you can stand on to help rebuilding. After your top layer is done, put a pressure plate on the block above the TNT. When a mob - or player - walks on the plate, the TNT will trigger, damaging him and making him fall to his death in the pit below. To collect the items, create a maintenance hallway to the bottom of the pit.
</p>
 <p>  <b>TNT-based pitfall trap (Easy)
</b></p> 
<p>Dig 3 blocks down but stay on the surface. Put a block of sand on the bottom of the hole, and a block of TNT on top of the sand. Place a pressure plate on top of the sand and when a mob steps on it, it will trigger the TNT and the mob will take damage and fall into the pit created by the explosion.
</p><p><b>WARNING!</b> <i>Mobs will NOT BE DEAD upon finding (unless they burn in sunlight). Shoot them with arrows until they die. Happy hunting!</i>
</p>

 <p>  <b>Cactus-based pitfall trap
</b></p> <p>
One way to dispatch a target is by filling the bottom of the shaft with cacti. Since a cactus can't be placed adjacent to any other blocks, a checkerboard pattern must be used. Players and most mobs will fall between the cactus and be unable to escape. Spiders, however, won't be able to fall between the cactus and, depending on the design of the shaft, may be able to escape before taking fatal damage. Want to make a cacti trap for greedy greifers? Dig a 4 block deep hole (so he can't escape!), place a cacti at the bottom of the pit, place a trapdoor on the pit with a sign above it saying, "Free Diamonds Down This Hole!"
</p> <p>
Another thing you should consider is that cacti destroy items.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Shallow pitfall
</b></p> <p>
Dig a pit 1-block deep hole at least 5x5 blocks. Place fences on the inside edge. Since fences count as one and one half blocks in height, mobs can walk in but can not jump out. Alternatively, line the outside with half-slabs.This can also be combined with a mob grinder, via water currents leading to it. Zombies and Skeletons will take damage from sunlight during the day if the pit is uncovered, making this an effective way to sort out creepers. This design does not capture spiders.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Water-current based pitfall trap
</b></p> <p>
To effectively improve the size of your pit without digging a larger area, dig a shallow ring around the top layer of your pit. Fill this area with water so that mobs will be dragged to the center. If necessary, water can be stopped by placing signs or Stone Pressure Plate.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Sand Pit
</b></p> <p>
Dig a 3x3x3 hole. Cover the bottom of the pit with torches. Place a tnt on the middle torch. Place signs all around the tnt, careful not to accidentally set it off. Place sand on top of the signs. Place a pressure plate over the tnt. When the mob or player steps on the pressure plate, the signs break, the sand falls and breaks on the torch, and the tnt is set off. The player can only escape if they can fly or dig really fast.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Fake Water Pitfall Trap
</b></p> <p>
Dig a hole (2x2 works best) at least 30 blocks deep, the deeper the better. At the bottom place lapis lazuli blocks/water source blocks covered with blue stained glass. Add a 'corridor' - a 2 block long hollow to one side of the bottom of the hole - to look as if the hole leads somewhere, and a torch somewhere in the 'corridor', and you're done. When an unsuspecting player comes across the hole, they will think that there is water at the bottom, jump down and die when they hit the lapis lazuli blocks/blue stained glass. Experienced players are less likely to fall for this particular trap but it generally works quite well.
</p> <p>
NOTE: If the target is wearing armor enchanted with feather falling, or has some sort of status effect that reduces damage taken, this trap becomes more or less obsolete unless you include a second trap, such as lava or arrow dispensers released or activated by concealed tripwire.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Snowball-based pitfall trap
</b></p> <p>
Load the dispenser with snowballs (or eggs if you find them easier to get and arrows if you wish), and aim the dispenser at a connected pressure plate next to the pit. When the target walks across the plate, the dispenser shoots a snowball to knock the target into the pit, where they can be dealt with however you like.
</p>

 <p>  <b>The Obscured Pit
</b></p> <p>
The mechanism is a pressure plate attached to 5 pistons: 4 pistons that retract, and one that extends. Build this in a flat sandy area. Wire the pressure plate to an inverter then to 4 sticky pistons 1 layer underground. When the plate activates, the pistons should open a 2x2 hole. Replace the sand on top of the extended pistons on the ground. Then, under the sand manipulated by the pistons, make a hole as deep as you want. It can have water supported by signs, so as not to kill your victim, or they can plummet to certain doom. Then, add a normal piston wired into the plate so as to push the victim into the opened shaft. Then, you can replace the top layer of sand.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Pitfall with Bait Block w/o Pressure Plate
</b></p> <p>
Beside the classic pressure plate activated pit fall trap, you can also trigger the mechanism with a block - when removed the block will cause the pit to collapse. <p>  <b>Pitfalls using pistons

  </p>


</b></p>  <p>  <b>Pitfalls using pistons
</b></p> 
<p> Another kind of pit is the piston pit. In this pit trap a sand structure is build on an activated piston. The structure itself uses torches to keep the sand at the top. The structure is build like an upside down pyramid so that one sand block is holding the others. When the piston is toggled, the main sand block above the piston will fall triggering a cascade in the rest.
</p> <p>
This trap is easy to reset if enough sand is available, you just have to put new sand on top of the piston and build a new sandfloor. If sand is scarce, you may want to build a maintenance shaft to the bottom of the pit to retrieve the sand.
</p> <p>
Repeatedly triggering a trap of this type without collecting the sand from the pit will eventually fill the entire pit with sand. To counter this, you can set up a floor of torches, redstone torches, redstone repeaters and/or tall grass. As the sand blocks fall on these objects, they will break and produce lootable sand blocks. These could possibly be collected (along with the victim's items) by the owner of the trap for future use, although they have to be picked up very soon after the trap has been triggered, as they will despawn in a couple of minutes like any other lootable items. A more elaborate system could even have the sand and items redirected to a water stream which leads them to a collection point.

</p>
<p>
A variation to this is to make it so that the sand crushes the victim when activated. However, this poses two major disadvantages. First of all, with updated minecraft the player will be pushed out from the sand. This can be countered by filling in the hanging 'pit' of sand in, making it so that there is no room to be pushed out into. The second problem is that no idiot wouldn't notice a giant structure of hanging sand above them.
</p>


 <p>  <b>Tripwire Piston Pitfall trap
</b></p> 
<p> A compact & fast design, can kill the target by any type of damage. Cheap & fast to build, yet does the job right and is almost undetectable. The victim is walking in a tunnel, there are no pressure plates, just a tripwire hanging at the target's head level. Once the victim touches the tripwire, a block is pushed up preventing the target from escaping and the pistons below quickly open up a hole and the target falls down in a pitfall. From there, you can do anything with the target.

</p>


 <p>  <b>Non-Destructive TNT Death Hole
</b></p> 
<p>This trap uses TNT, but does not destroy the pit or any blocks other than the sand/gravel disguising the pit.
Dig a deep 6x6 hole. put obsidian in the bottom and sides of the hole,turning your 6x6 shaft into an obsidian tube with a 2x2 hole. Put a redstone wire on one of the obsidian blocks at the top layer of the pipe. Put TNT next to the wire, above the hole at the top of the pipe, and disguise the pit with dirt etc., but put sand/gravel above the tnt. It should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>R R
O T TO
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O0O0OO
</pre>
<p>P= Pressure Plate<br />
R= redstone wire<br />
T= TNT<br />
O= obsidian<br />
</p><p>Wire the TNT to a trigger, ensuring that players will walk onto/near the sand/gravel and activate the TNT. The TNT drops them into the hole, and blows up without destroying any blocks other than the sand that the player stood on. All you need to do is replace the TNT, sand and the trigger for another use.
This could perhaps be wired to some pistons that automatically reload the TNT and sand.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Fake Water Elevator
</b></p> 
<p>You will need 1 bucket of water and 30+ signs.
<br /><br />
Make a 1x1x1 hole on the ground and empty the bucket in the hole. Break the block under the block of water then place a sign. Dig deeper until the hole is 30-40 which is enough to kill a player, make sure you place signs 1 block far from each other to make it look like as if it was a real elevator. You may need to place a sign near the 'elevator' saying something like "Do not enter!" or "Elevator to my base! Don't jump in!".
<br /><br />
You can also make the signs' text something like a floor countdown like "35", "34", "33", etc. so players are more likely to fall for the trap.

If you want, you can place hoppers and with chests so you can gather the loot from the victims, but if you really want the drops, you need a secret passage to the bottom of the pit for collection.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Sand Update Trap
</b></p> <p>
You can cause sand to float mid air until it receives a block update by using any two block tall plant. First, clear out a 3x3x3 area, ideally in a desert or on a beach. Then at the bottom center of the area, break the block and put a dirt block in it's place. Place a two block tall plant on the dirt, and place the sand on top. It should then look like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing23.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>
Now refill the 3x3x3 area surrounding the sand in plant, but make sure you can still reach the dirt and bottom block of the plant from one side (place a sign there):
</p><p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing24.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>
Now make some way to update the sand block when a player or mob walks nearby. The simplest and least visible method of doing this is placing a string on top:
</p><p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing25.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>
When a player or entity steps on the string, it will update the sand, causing them to fall.
</p><p>
Now carefully break the <b>bottom</b> part of the plant. This should leave the sand floating with no blocks below it. Remove the dirt, and you have a sand update trap.

 <p>  <b>TNT pitfall trap (hard)
</b></p> 
<p>This is an easier trap, since you can no longer create the sand update trap. Also, sign can be placed on top of signs.
</p>
<p>You will need:
<br/>
Lava<br/>
Signs<br/>
ONE TNT.<br/>
Sand/gravel (sand works best in desert and gravel works best for stone stuff and other stuff.)
</p>

<br />Side view
</p>

<p>
Make a hole as wide as you want BUT, the hole must be 3 blocks deep. First, add lava on top of the signs. Then at the 2nd layer, add the TNT anywhere and then place the signs on it. Keep on going until you had filled the hole with 1 TNT and lot's of signs. Then fill the layer with gravel. The sign can hold the gravel. Lastly, add a STONE pressure plate on top of the block with TNT underneath. Voila! You have created the pitfall trap! When a player lands on it, they will fall and die in lava!

 <p>  <b>False-floor trap</b></p> 
<p>A false-floor trap is a variation of a pitfall trap. It works by creating a concealed safe route through the pitfall (which is usually very big) to allow authorised players to pass, while catching unauthorised players or mobs and killing them. It generally works best when there is no way around, forcing the player to pass through the trap.
</p><p>
Dig a seven-layer deep hole. The trap works best if the sides of the hole are very long, but this also makes it more tedious (and more dangerous). Fill in the bottom two layers with water. Fill the second from the top layer with TNT, except for the squares that form the safe route. Fill in the safe squares with stone. Now, cover the whole thing with gravel or sand. Finally, place stone pressure plates on top of every square (if you use wooden ones, the player can just shoot them to find the safe ones). If you walk along the safe route, nothing will happen. If you hit one of the false squares, it will drop you into the water then detonate the TNT. To make it more effective, dig a deeper pit and/or use lava or cactus at the bottom. Make sure that you remember the safe route!
</p>

<h2>Liquid Traps</h2>
<p>Fluids are often used in traps. Water is generally used to slow players and to drag mobs, but can also be used to drown them. It also can be used to create an explosion that will not damage the environment. Lava works entirely different by igniting the target. It is a very effective way of killing the target, but also destroys drops if they come in contact.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Water</b></p> 
<p>
 Traps that are partially reliant on water.
</p>
  <p>  <b> Lily pad trap
</b></p> 
<p>Dig a 2x2 hole at least 8 blocks deep and fill it with water. Place a chest at the bottom. When someone goes in to get items from the chest put lily pads on the water and soon they will drown.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Fake underwater mine trap
</b></p> 
<p>This one is fairly simple (but time consuming). Dig a 2 x 2 hole at least 28 blocks deep, or more if the target is wearing armor.(Note:Only dig deeper if the target is wearing boots enchanted with feather falling as fall damage ignores armor) Put signs in the second block after the surface and make a water pool, so there`s nothing but air below. So, put a sign saying something like: "Diamonds here!" or "Mine" or even "Do not enter"(Nobody can resist a sign that says "Do not enter"). The unfortunate player will jump in it and die from fall damage. This trap does have the inherent design flaw in that a player can easily circumvent the fall by placing water below the bottom sign, or using an ender pearl to teleport to the bottom, so it is recommended that you place another method of killing the person at the bottom (i.e. land mine, lava or a crushing piston that is triggered with a pressure plate).
</p>
 <p>  <b>Slime Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This simple trap targets slimes. All you need is some water buckets. Dig a 4x4 hole three blocks deep. Fill the bottom layer with water, so that it is all still water on the bottom. When any sized slime wanders around, it may fall into the hole. Since slimes cannot jump in water, it will not be able to escape. You can come by later and kill all the slimes, however, you must jump in then get the drops. If you are not interested in the drops, just leave them in to lower slime population. This trap is recommended on Superflat survival worlds where you can get water from village farms and easily make the hole and slimes spawn a lot.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Mobavators - Move Mobs To Other Traps
</b></p> 
<p>Mobavators can be used to move mobs from spawners to wherever you want, and they can haul a lot of mobs up.<br>
Usually mobavators are expensive when moving mobs from deep underground, but for players with a lot of resources they can be very useful. The usually work like this:
</p>
<dl><dd>X = Sign</dd></dl>
<p>Y = Glass/Any other solid block<br>
O = Water
</p>
<dl><dd><tt>YXXY</dd>
<dd>YOOY</dd>
<dd>YXXY</dd>
<dd>YOOY</dd>
<dd>YXXY</tt></dd></dl>
<p>An alternate design:
</p>
<dl><dd><tt>YXOY</dd>
<dd>YOXY</dd>
<dd>YXOY</dd>
<dd>YOXY</dd>
<dd>YXOY</tt></dd></dl>

 <p>  <b>Drowning Room</b></p> 
<p>Make a small room, preferably 5x5x2. Place a chest in the center of the back wall. Then put 2 blocks of sand above the chest with water behind it. As soon as they break the sand to enter the chest, the water will pour out. If you want, you could have an airlock instead of the one-way door. Have torches supporting sand in the hallway to the trap. As soon as the water comes out it will flood the hallway and burn out the torches, causing the sand to fall and trap the player even more.
</p><p>Another way to drown a player and collect their items is to make a trap shower. All you need is 4 useless blocks, 1 stone pickaxe, 4 iron doors, 1 any type of slab except weak slabs, a water bucket, a 3x3 space, and lastly a pressure plate. First plan the 3x3 space and place a pressure plate in the middle, next you must be very careful, place the iron doors carefully so when the player steps on the pressure plate the iron doors will "open" making the player trapped inside because of the pressure plate. When it is done it should look like this: I=Iron Door P=Pressure Plate O=No Block @=Player
</p><p>OIO
IPI
OIO
</p><p>When the player inside it should look like this:
</p><p>OIO
OIO
</p><p>Then use the 4 useless blocks to place the slab on top so it is only 2 blocks high, then place the water bucket above. When the player gets inside then it will get trapped, to collect his loot, get inside, collect the items then destroy the slab, get out then replace it. Best in multiplayer.
</p><p><b>Deep water</b>
</p><p>You'll need: 2 buckets of water, an ocean, 8 ladders, 5 torches, 4 signs, 4 hoppers(optional), any pickaxe, and any shovel. This trap depends on a player's curiosity. It is highly suggested that you put all your other stuff away because the chance of you drowning while your in the trap is very high, and you use stone tools.
</p><p>First, dig a 2-by-2 1 block deep pit. Then, place signs. The signs will block the water from going into the trap. Dig one block deeper. Then, place 4 torches in the pit, directly under the signs so players will see it. Mine 2 more blocks deeper, then place 8 ladders. Mine 3 blocks from the ladders. Then, place your buckets so an infinite source block is created. Dig down, and use your last torch to prevent you from drowning. Make it really deep, so players have a hard time getting out. Then, your done. If you don't want to go through the treble of getting the stuff, then place some hoppers.
</p>

 <p>  <b> The Pool Of Death</b></p> 
<p>This trap is simple and may not work on experienced players. First, dig a 2x2 hole 5 blocks deep. Fill the bottom two with lava, the middle with signs, and the top two with water. You can drop items in the hole at your own risk. When a player or mob swims in the pool, they will fall down through the water and into the lava!
</p>


  <p>  <b>Automatic Drowning Trap w/ Trapdoors
</b></p> 
<p>This trap is made by digging a 2x2x3 hole in the ground, filling the middle of the hole in with water, and putting trapdoors at the top. Place pressure plates a block away from the trap in a square pattern so that, at the moment, they can't open the trap doors. Between the pressure plates and the trap, place redstone wire to open all the doors at once. When a mob walks over the pressure plates he can fall down the water, and the trapdoors will shut, forcing him to drown. At the lowest level of the trap you can make a 1x1 tunnel of water to retrieve the loot. Generally these are the most efficient types of traps because there is no lava involved to burn any loot.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Retrieval Traps

<br />
A trap made with water and dirt which can kill any mob.
</p>
<p>
Create a water current that drags the mobs down under a solid block. The current will hold the mobs under until they drown. The loot from the mobs will sink, which can be collected below.

</p>
<p>
This trap is used as a water barrier to keep the mobs from swimming into another area. This requires that the floor of the body of water be easily accessible. The trap is extremely effective, but it's rather large, sucking in a 6x6 area of water.
</p><p>
Dive down to the bottom of the pool of water. Build up a hollow tower out of a weak material, ideally sand. The basic template is a square hole, at least 2x2. The air gap will be this size.

<br />x = sand O = empty</p>
<dl><dd>x = sand O = empty</dd>
<dd>O X X O</dd>
<dd>X O O X</dd>
<dd>X O O X</dd>
<dd>O X X O</dd></dl>
<p>Make the top flush with the surface, then empty the tower of water using a bucket. Set four TNT blocks as low as possible, then light the TNT and run.
<br />T = TNT X = sand O = empty
</p>

 <p>  <b>Trapping Pool</b></p> 
<p>This trap is designed to trap skeletons and zombies, not to kill them! Start on the surface by digging out a 5x5 square.Then dig a 3x3 square in the center. Dig the 3x3 one more layer deep and climb out. Place water in each of the corners and in the middle of each side on the top (where the water isn't flowing along the top. Done.
</p><p>When morning arrives you may find a live zombie to kill or unleash upon unsuspecting village, or a skeleton to use to get a music disc or to snipe. This system can also be hooked up to a mob grinder, or if you dig the middle square down you can place some lava/cactus/iron golem/snow golem (just for the laughs)/TNT/dispenser/place to spatter from fall damage/mob arena (figure this out yourself!)/Void hole(sadly unsatisfactory)/ mine cart transport for later torment/etc,etc. Just make sure you use a sign to cut off the flow.

 <p>  <b>Lava</b></p> 
 <p>Traps that require lava.

 <p>  <b>Trapped Chest Lava Pitfall Trap
</b></p> 
<p> YouTube 视频 (<a target="_self" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xab5AF4JYr0?">https://www.youtube.com/embed/xab5AF4JYr0?</a>)
</p>
<p>
You will need: Sticky Pitons, Trapped Chest, Redstone, Blocks, Lava Buckets, Redstone Repeater Build the 2 rows sticky pistons such that are facing each other and the rows are 4 blocks apart. Attach solid blocks to the rows of sticky pistons. Link the rows of pistons to redstone torches. Attach the trapped chest to the redstone torhces that is connected to the sticky pistons. Dig a hole below the sticky pistons and fill it with lava. Decorate the area around the trapped chest to attract players!
</p>
 <p>  <b>Lava mob farm (works for PE)
</b></p> <p>
you will need: lava buckets, water buckets, ladders, pickaxe dig a huge cavern with no lighting and water streams pointing to a hole in the middle make sure the water ends just next to the hole but doesn't fall in at the bottom of the hole make a cave 3 by 9 blocks and place water in 2 adjacent corners. on the blocks where there is no water dig down three blocks and place water in one of them in the second block of the hole place ladders. on the top block of the hole place lava. when the mobs spawn they flow into the stream, fall through the hole and get killed by lava and the stuff flows out the stream where you can collect it
</p>  <p>
NOTE: This trap does not work well on spiders, endermen, or witches (they will drink fire resistance potions)
</p>


 <p>  <b>Lava elevator trap
</b></p> 
<p>
This trap is an elevator This trap has lava hidden in it so that when a player/mob swims upward it burns and dies in the lava.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Lava ladder trap
</b></p> 
<p>
This is designed for use on a SMP server. Make a 'dummy house' (A house that is not really a house, it is only to lure people). Put ladders up to the second floor of this house and place lava at the top of the ladder. The lava will not flow down or hurt you because of the ladders. When someone goes up the ladder they may climb into the lava, because some players often don't look up when climbing. The player usually falls off the ladder, so their items won't burn. This trap will also work downwards but it is not very effective.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Emergency Lock Down Trap
</b></p> <p>
An emergency lock down trap ensures players can't bypass the trap redstone lock system by breaking the door. It uses an iron door as support for the initial sand block. A diagram for the completed section of the corridor can be found below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing32.png" />
<br />
Side View
</p>
<p>
Place the iron door in the middle of a tunnel with adequate space. Connect the iron door to a redstone lock system. Dig above the door until the area above the hall is a hollow 5x3 area. Place sand on top of the door, then place torches on the side of the sand. Repeat until the sand touches the wall. Place lava in the empty space above the sand. The only way to get through would be to unlock the redstone lock system. If someone destroyed the door, the sand would be unsupported allowing the lava to fall on them. To stop players from simply mining around the device, place lava behind the walls.</p>
<p>
Since lava spreads slowly, it may be possible for the thief to destroy the door then quickly run to safety on the far side. To counteract this, include an airlock style sand pillar to block the path. If the thief tries to break it down, the lava will have enough time to spread and ignite him. Also, lava spreads more quickly in the Nether.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Glass Pane Trap
</b></p> 
<p>With the glass panes and the ability to fall through them when joined in a 2x2 fashion, this can be made into a good trap. Lava can work in this fashion to have drops fall into the chamber below the lava.
</p><p>LL
</p><p>GG
</p><p>GG
</p><p>EE
</p><p>where<br>
L=lava<br>
G=glass pane or iron bar<br>
E=empty, used for collection.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Pitfall Lava Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This trap is based on the fact that, when unsupported, sand and gravel fall.
</p><p>First, dig a hole that is at least 6 blocks deep. Next, at the bottom of the hole, dig out a pit that is about 3x3 and 2 blocks high. Fill the pit with lava and get back to the surface. 3 blocks down into the hole, place TNT. On top of the TNT, place either sand or gravel, and put a pressure plate on top of that.
</p><p>When a player steps on this trap, the TNT will activate and the player will fall into a pit of lava, taking some lit TNT with them. To reset this trap you simply need to place the TNT, the sand, and the pressure plate back to where they started.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Lava Pit Door
</b></p> 
<p>Very simple, put a door on your home and right inside the door dig a 1x1 pit and fill it with lava. Make a hole in the ceiling and a ladder so that you can safely get in. Players who don't know the ruse will go in through the front/trapped door and die in lava. Remember to always use the side entrance, because falling into your own trap will be humiliating, I assure you.
</p>

 <p>  <b>One False Mine...
</b></p> 
<p>
What you need: TNT, Redstone, Pressure plate, Iron door, Lava, and any kind of Ores.
</p><p>
Make a mine that leads to a dungeon. Place a trapdoor hiding sand and/or gravel connected to a stone pressure plate above and under your every step. When you get to the dungeon, place a stone pressure plate connected to a TNT block nearby. Underneath the TNT place lava. Above all the TNT place any ore and when the victim goes toward the lava to get more ore they die. Use doors in the cavern because the victim—if they survive—may want to explore the cavern and place doors that he/she may want to enter and make a 1 block wide hole going really deep down and place lava at least 3 blocks tall behind each door. Above the hole make lava fall onto the victim.
</p><p>
Add more TNT connected to pressure plates and do the lava/ore press wire.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Lava Sticky Piston Trap
</b></p> 
<p>What you need: Redstone, Pressure plate, Lava, and a Sticky piston
</p>
<p>Make a lava pit. It is recommended you do this trap in a mine with a lava pit; it will blend in better. Place a stone pressure plate down and connect it to redstone wire behind a wall so it cannot be seen. Make the redstone wire connect to a sticky piston with a stone block on the plunger so the stone block is pushed when the pressure plate is activated. Put the piston two blocks above ground level, where the pressure plate is, so that when the pressure plate is activated, it activates the sticky piston, pushing the player. Make a lava pit next to the pressure plate so the player is pushed into lava.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Lava Zombie Trap
</b></p> 
<p>What you need: Lava, Door
</p><p>
Make a 3x3x3 pit, but leave the middle blocks. Fill the bottom of the pit with lava and place a door atop the central pillar of blocks. The zombies can't resist the need to break the door and will die. Using netherrack and fire in place of lava also works.
</p>
 <p>  <b>Final Resting Place
</b></p> 
<p>Possibly the most evil trap ever made is a bed based one. After sleeping in a bed you appear in one of the blocks immediately next to the bed (including diagonal). Sometimes though it's through a wall. If you can't imagine how that would happen, imagine a bed in the corner of a simple 3x3 house in which the corners of the exterior of the house are missing. The blocks beside the left of the bed and top of the bed are blocked because of the walls but the corner one (to the left and up at the same time) isn't blocked it's just outside. Someone sleeping here could find themselves standing in that missing outside corner in the morning. Now imagine an underground house with a lava chamber hidden behind the corner of the room like that and half slabs everywhere beside the bed on the safe side. Lava doesn't count as an obstruction but slabs do, so as far as the game is concerned that lava block is the only spot available. It looks harmless enough since you can't see the lava hidden behind the corner of the room. But after their sleep finishes they wake up in flames. The worst part is that upon dying they will respawn back at this bed...in the only block beside the bed that is open. Yes, the lava again. They're stuck. They need either water, creative mode, op's help, or to go find another server to play on.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Greed is your DOWNFALL</b></p> 
<p>
Dig a 9x9, 3 block deep area in a desert, and replace the 4th layer with Dirt. Put down Grass and grow it to Double Tallgrass. Put Sand on top of the Double Tallgrass, except for the middle. Put a Trapped Chest there. Then break the Double Tallgrass. (Make sure to have an escape tunnel or you could be in trouble!) Finally, replace the Dirt with Lava. When some griefer opens the Trapped Chest, they will fall into the Lava and die! You can replace the Lava with TNT and Pressure Plates for an even more damaging, but more destructive trap.

<p>
This trap utilizes wandering mobs, trap doors, lava, and pressure plates. To see how it's made, view the diagram on the left, and to see it in game, view the image beneath it.
</p>
<p>This trap can also be made with water and signs. Make the hole 3x3x4 instead, and fill the bottom with signs, and replace the lava with water. This takes away the problem of having to collect lava. This will also fix the problem of the lava destroying the mob drops.
</p>

 <p>  <b> 	Lava Filling Trap</b></p> 
<p>Make a room out of STONE, not cobble. Place a stone pressure plate connected to a hidden redstone trail leading to a dispenser in the ceiling with a lava bucket inside. The rest works out for itself.
</p>


<h2>Other traps and parts</h2>
 <p>  <b>Noob Traps</b></p> 
<p>These traps work best on noobs. This is because they stand out the most.
</p>


 <p>  <b>4 Doors</b></p> 
<p>This noob trap has 2 forms, basic and advanced. All you need is 4 iron doors, a pressure plate, and bedrock. If you choose the advanced form, also use a command block. To make the basic form, put a pressure plate down in the center, put iron doors on the rim (make sure they close when powered), and place bedrock above the pressure plate, high enough so the victim can go in, but not high enough for the victim to jump. When the victim goes in, he will trigger the pressure plate, which closes the doors. The bedrock is there to stop the victim from jumping. If the victim jumps, the pressure plate will deactivate. For the advanced form, do the same as above, but place a command block under the pressure plate, far enough to be unseen, but close enough to be triggered. Set the command to "/gamemode 2 @p[r=4]", which will change the game mode of the closest player that is within 4 blocks to adventure. The player is always the victim, unless the trap is triggered by a mob. If a mob triggers the trap, then the game mode of the closest player within 4 blocks is still changed. You can also use a redstone repeater to set off another command block. The second command block should have this command: "/effect @p[r=4] minecraft:slowness 60 100000", which will give the victim the "Slowness" status effect at level 60, which will completely immobilize the victim, for 100000 ticks, which will give the effect permanently, unless the victim has some milk, or has access to the "/effect" or "/gamemode" command. Also, the victim will need access to the "/gamemode" command to escape the trap, because the victim's game mode will be set to "Adventure", which will stop the victim from placing or breaking blocks. This will stop the victim from ever escaping, unless he has access to the "/gamemode", "/give", or "/tp", and "/kill", "/effect", or, if the server has the mod, "/punish". The punishment must be a one which moves the player.
(Note: If the victim sprints, he can escape this trap, unless you use the advanced form with the slowness effect)

</p>

 <p>  <b>House of Horror (useful for griefers)</b></p> 
<p>Make a fake base with walls and an attractive outside to attract potential griefers. Trap the door so through attempted exit, the victim might die through lava. If the victim tries to get out of the house early, he will realize that a dispenser revealed by a sticky piston compartment with a released lava bucket has blocked his escape through the iron door.
</p><p>If the victim blunders up the stairs, he hears a small but foreboding sound and realizes that he's standing on a pressure plate hidden from his view which sets off a TNT trap. He is forced to go further up and realizes that the stairs are very long.From here on continue torturing the victim in this manner. As soon as your test subject goes in, they will get the terror of their lives!
</p><p>Note: Any person entering this trap can simply break out of the house if it is made of weak materials(dirt etc.). Use materials such as obsidian or find some other way to prevent the griefer from exiting. It is best to find some way to keep him going higher and higher up and not trying to leave.
</p>


 <p>  <b>The KILL land mine</b></p> 
<p>Sick of rebuilding land mines? Not any more as the land mine NEVER explodes. Plus, it can kill a player when he/she steps on the pressure plate.
You will need:
</p>
<ul><li> 1 wooden pressure plate</li>
<li> 1 command block.</li>
<li> 17 cobblestone.</li></ul>
<p>Always set the command to <code>/effect @e[r=2] 7 4 7</code>. Dig 2 blocks down and 3x3 blocks wide. Place the command block in the middle of the hole like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing36.png" />
<br />
</p>

<p>Cover the hole with cobblestone. Place the wooden pressure plate in the middle of the cobblestone square. So when a player lands on it, it will kill them!
</p>


 <p>  <b>Pros (Advantages)</b></p> 
<ul><li> They can kill a player in ONE hit.</li>
<li> You don't have to build a landmine again.</li></ul>


 <p>  <b>Cons (Disadvantages)</b></p> 
<ul><li> You may get killed when you are near (not on) the landmine by items flying down onto the pressure plate. (This can be avoided by using a stone pressure plate.)</li>
<li> Some servers may change the command from <code>/effect @p 7 4 6</code> to <code>/effect @p 11 1000000 5</code>.</li>
<li> Alternately you can use the code <code>/tp @p ~0 -3 ~0</code> which teleports them into the void.</li></ul>


 <p>  <b>Command Block Traps</b></p> 
<p>These are quite effective traps that use command blocks.
1. Proximity Mine
Place a command block connected to a redstone clock, faster the better, and use this command /kill @e[r=10] ~ ~ ~
Any entity within 10 blocks will be destroyed. This is also good for preventing primed TNT from getting near or arrows from flying at you.
</p>


 <p>  <b>Entry Alarm</b></p> 
<p>This is not so much as a trap but an alarm. If a person or entity walks over a pressure plate or tripwire which activates turns on a redstone wire which triggers a note block. You could use different sounding note block for different entries/exits if you have more than one.
</p>


 <p>  <b>Proximity Detector</b></p> 
<p>There is a way to detect if someone is within a certain proximity (17-20 blocks) in Minecraft. This is extremely useful for traps. Here is a video tutorial on how to do that:
</p><p><b>Mob-spawning-based:</b>

 <p>  <b>Diamond Block of DOOM</b></p> 
<p>Put down a BUD switch made out of a sticky piston, slime block and redstone block. Next to the piston, put a diamond block, and above where the Noob will be standing and next to,(but on the same side as the diamond block) but above the redstone block, put a redstone line leading up to about 5 dispensers full of TNT. When the Noob tries to break the block with his iron pickaxe(silly Noob!) the BUD switch will activate, and you can come back to see a room full of broken gadgetry, dirt, and wool dye. Specifically, rose red. Please note that this will only work on the most inexperienced of people. We're talking first day levels of ignorance.

 <p>  <b>Netherrack and cacti wall</b></p> 
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing37.png" />
<br />A trap made with Netherrack and Cacti.
</p><p>
In the ground, alternate netherrack and sand. Ignite the netherrack and plant cactus on the sand. This very simple trap acts as a wall against hostile mobs. Passive mobs only spawn in light (They are NOT attracted to light in any way and will often despawn in the dark) and will sometimes wander into the fire. Generally the mob will then ricochet off the cactus preventing any drops from being destroyed by the fire.

 <p>  <b>Soul Sand Live Capture</b></p> 
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing38.jpg" />
<br />
Players enter from red, the turn helps hide the soul sand.
</p><p>
Soul sand slightly sinks the player or mobs. Using this unique property, it is possible to capture a tall mob or player. The corridor to the right will trap a player that moves onto the soul sand. The top half shows the floor setup and the bottom half shows the ceiling. Note the open block above the soul sand. Players are caught until they place a block above them or destroy a block around them. Generally the rest of the trap will have triggered by the time they react. Pressure plates can be placed on soul sand to help hide them and to provide a redstone signal. NOTE:For a kill during this process, place lava by the soul sand. May not always work if placed incorrectly.

 <p>  <b>Repeater-based One Way Hallway</b></p> 
<p>
If a repeater is in a 2 block high space, like a tunnel, you will crouch automatically as you walk over it. However, you will not crouch if the repeater is blocking the entrance of a tunnel.
</p>

<p>Make a 1x2 tunnel. On the floor of the entrance place a repeater. To punish players for destroying the repeater, have it as part of an inverter connected to TNT, such that when the repeater is destroyed, it activates nearby TNT.
</p>

 <p>  <b> Minecart Fall Damage Trap
</b></p> 
<p>There is a way to 'store' fall damage in a minecart and later have someone take that damage even though they don't actually fall a distance that would make them take damage. Here is a video explaining how to set the trap up and showing it in use:

</p>

 <p>  <b>Noise machine
</b></p> 
<p>In certain cases it may be helpful to mask the sound of TNT* or hostile mobs by creating a noisy machine. The function of the machine itself isn't important. Pistons create a fair amount of noise that doesn't travel far, however it should <i>look</i> like it is doing something useful. Doors can be quickly toggled making a lot of noise. You can also group many animals together to make noise. A simple BUD that uses Redstone blocks, a repeater and a sticky piston, when the normal piston is built and then removed will also constantly trigger after being updated (be warned about the lag caused by a piston that moves every 2 Redstone ticks.)
</p>


 <p>  <b>One Way Door and Soul sand Room Trap
</b></p> 
<p>A one way door is made by placing a pressure plate in front of an iron door to a closed room with no way to open the door from the inside. The pressure plate briefly activates the door, but will close it immediately after. This technique is useful for capturing mobs for resource harvesting. This can be expanded to create rooms or large pens for trapping monsters.
</p>
<p>Another way to use one way doors is the soul sand room trap. This is a combo trap made by making a room about 5x6. Dig two blocks deep and fill the pit with one block of lava and cover it with soul sand. Now put an iron door on both sides of the room with pressure plates on the outer side. This makes it impossible to escape with even a wood door, which is slightly less conspicuous. This is a way to collect the items and all you need to escape and not get stuck is a block of dirt. Place it then break it when you're out.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Forcefield Trap
</b></p> 
<p>This trap is based on the forcefield, that the mine carts create when stacked together in a small amount of space. It is possible to hide this design behind walls to push players off and kill them from fall damage / lava damage. However, this trap is very iron-costly, for it to be efficient you will need around 250 iron, and the number increases, depending on how powerful you want the forcefield to be. This does NOT work with Modloader in Minecraft or Bukkit MP servers.

 <p>  <b>Anvil Traps</b></p> 

 <p>  <b>Anvil Player Trap</b></p> 
<p>Simply set up two pressure plates in front of two large iron doors. Make this entrance as ornate as possible, to fool the victim into thinking this is the entrance to your house. Place the doors sideways and place torches under them so they appear closed but are actually locked open. By doing this the pressure plates won't work. Run redstone lines from underneath the plates onto the roof of your porch to trigger two pistons. The redstone lines should have an inverter in so the pistons are extended by default. Put an anvil on each extended piston arm, and make sure there is a hole through the porch roof down to the entrance where the player stands. When the player stands on the pressure plates, the doors won't open and while they are confused the anvils will fall on them. They will either be killed or if the anvils don't fall from high enough they get injured. This trap is useful to stop thieves from staling valuable goods, and exploits the fact that people don't look up.

<p>Next fire a ton of arrows at the dirt and tnt and build a staircase from the room to the tunnel hide the stairwell with plain stone but dig one space below the hidden doorway and one behind that into the starwell. place a pressure plate next to the hidden door and run redstone from it to the tnt in the top room. Now, when a player sets off this plate it causes the tnt to explode with the dirt, (not blasting the arrows away because of a patch) with the dirt no longer there to hold the arrows they will free-fall down at the intruder at the same power as a fully charged arrow.
P.S. It helps to have the intersecting tunnel wider then the hole itself as to reduce chance of arrows sticking into walls.
</p>


 <p>  <b>Fire Arrow Trap</b></p> 
<p>This trap will rain down flaming arrows on an unfortunate player. First, make a long hallway with lava walls which look like decoration (Leave the lava open to the hallway).
Next put a pressure plate, button, lever, or whatever activation device you want. Connect it to a pulser, then to a line of dispensers filled with arrows. When the player activates the trap, they will be showered with flaming arrows coming out of the walls!
</p>


 <p>  <b> Perfect Player/Mob Trap</b></p> 
<p>Dig four 1x1 holes (as shown below) into the ground and in the holes place a piston and in the middle place a pressure plate. Now all you have to do is occasionally check the trap for players and or mobs.

 <p>  <b>The Trap of Eternal Imprisoning</b></p> 
  <p>If your mate activates this trap successfully, he is as good as banned, unless he has ender pearls.
The trap consists of any switch (pressure plate is probably the best one) and two sticky pistons. Upon activation the pistons start to repeatedly move after one another with the victim being between them. This causes the player to move so fast that even with a diamond pickaxe he/she won't be able to break free. Make sure that the space is closed.
The harder the material you use is, the better, but do note that pistons can't move obsidian.
</p><p>NOTE: It is not confirmed if you can break free from a stone made trap with a diamond pickaxe enchanted with efficiency, however with 3 ender pearls, you can spam two, glitching you halfway through the block and using the last one, escape far away.
</p><p>NOTE: The player will eventually starve to death, and if not, the trap may create extreme lag.

 <p>  <b> Tripwire Traps</b></p> 
This video is an example of several traps you could make with tripwires. There are many more ways you could sneak tripwire in to kill your victim, just think of the basic actions you would do in Minecraft, and try to sneak a tripwire somewhere in it.

 <p>  <b>Gravel Suffocation Trap</b></p> 
<p>Probably the simplest trap in Minecraft. Dig 1x1 holes 2 blocks deep; wait for a player or mob to fall in, and then suffocate him with gravel. Get their items out of the hole. Or, make an entire redstone contraption with pistons that release to drop the gravel!
</p>


 <p>  <b>Murder Holes</b></p> 
<p>Note: This trap is designed for player sized mobs like zombies. It also does not work well on other players. Nevertheless, when done en masse in a ring around the structure being protected, it works relatively well.
Dig many 1x1 holes four blocks into the ground.. Then, make a two block high tunnel along one of the edges of the holes that runs ONE BLOCK DEEPER than the bottom of the holes. Then, put signs on the top of the holes to fool mobs into falling in. Go into your tunnel and kill the mobs by yourself while they stand in the hole helplessly.

  <p>  <b>Suffocation Tower</b></p> 
 <p>(Note: Only suitable for 1 block wide mob. However, a two block variant can also be created)</p>
<p>
Requirements: Cobblestone (as much as possible),Sand or Gravel (2),Pressure Plate (1),Iron Door (2) ,Trapdoor (1), Any redstone trigger, Ladder (at least three)

</p><p>Make a 3 by 3 by 5 tower out of cobblestone. It should have a 1 block space inside, with walls that are 5 blocks high. Make a trapdoor floor for getting out of the tower later. You need to place an iron door in a doorway. Then place a pressure plate in front of the iron door. The mob will step on the pressure plate and will open the door for a time, long enough to let him in, but not long enough to let him out. Get to the top of the tower and suffocate the mob inside with your gravity-affected blocks. Make a tunnel outside with a staircase. Remember to close the trapdoor floor! You should be able to get up to the top of the tower, and drop sand or gravel on the mobs. Then dig the sand or gravel out, and go through your tunnel to the outside.

 <p>  <b>The Top of Hell</b></p> 
<p>Warning: This trap works ONLY in the nether.
</p>


 <p>  <b>For noobs</b></p> 
<p>Get a noob to go with you to the nether. Explode the nether portal. Go to the top of the nether (one block below void). Find an opening to the void and tell him the only way out is to use enderpearls. Give him a stack and make him teleport there. He will never be able to get back down.
</p>


 <p>  <b>For non-noobs</b></p> 
<p>Dig underneath your nether portal and put a command block there. Place a pressure plate next to it. Type the command "tp @p[name=!&lt;your name&gt;] ~ 130 ~". Now wait for someone to enter!
</p>


 <p>  <b>Capture Trap</b></p> 
<p>This trap can be used to capture mobs like zombies, skeletons, endermen, creepers, cows, sheep, pigs, horses and other players without completely killing them. You can then hit them without getting hurt yourself. This is how it works: Dig a 5 block deep hole in the ground, then use a sticky piston and a dirt block to close the top of your trap so nobody suspects you. The sticky piston will be very visible, so place one dirt block, and grow a tree on top of it. At the base of your hole, dig a ten block long corridor. Exit your hole. Then dig a 5 block deep trench that is parallel to your corridor, and fill in the walls and floor with obsidian or bedrock (in creative). Then, place an extra layer of obsidian/bedrock so that your corridor's wall has one block missing on the top layer. When mobs or players fall into the trench, they won't be able to escape. If you want, you can put ladders on one side, to make it look like it isn't a trap, and then once a player climbs down the ladder, you can use a sticky piston to bush one block with the ladders on it out of the wall, to that nobody can come out again, or you could use a row of sticky pistons to close off the top of the hole. Once a player/mob is trapped in the trench, you can hit their feet with a sword, a bow or your fists. You may want to include a chest with a tempting reward inside the trench, or a sign saying 'Diamonds/Emeralds Below!. You could even convince a player to trap themselves, by making a redstone switch that expels the ladder, and pushes/destroys the switch so that the player cannot flick it a second time. WARNING! THIS TRAP WILL NOT WORK ON MOBS THAT ARE 1 BLOCK HIGH, for example, spiders, chickens and small slimes.
</p>


<h2>Disarming Traps</h2>
<p>When faced with a trap, the safest course of action is often to leave the way you came, or disarm the trigger by destroying the trap's components. Note that disarming a trap could be
  griefing, but if they are trying to kill you, you should defend yourself.
</p>
<ul><li> You can dispatch active redstone wires with the use of two redstone torches:</li></ul>
<pre>X = torch Y = redstone wire B= Any block
Front view:
XYX
BBB
Top view:
Layer 1:
B B
BBB
Layer 2:
X X
YYY
And then destroy the center redstone:
X X
Y Y
It will keep the positive input for both ends, but cutting the two ends off, keeping the current
on forever.
</pre>
<p><b>Note: Some traps make use of the 15-block redstone signal limit. Trying to dispatch active redstone wire this way may trigger traps that use this concept.</b>
</p>
<ul><li> Consider the fact that the creator may be nearby. Oftentimes, the builder of a trap will be near the trap, waiting to collect his victim's possessions. If you encounter a trap, be ready for a fight.</li>
<li> Some texture packs may make traps easier to disarm than others. While you might accidentally walk across a pressure plate and activate a trap while using one texture pack, you may spot it instantly with a different one. It may also help to use an x-ray texture pack to spot parts of the trap that you may not have been able to see before, which should help you better understand how the trap works.</li>
<li> To fool the person who laid the trap in SMP, try subtle sabotage, but make sure you know the wiring absolutely. Therefore, if you want revenge unto the person who tricked you into the trap, you can leave a trace and then the person will want to fix it. Kill him once that happens.</li>
<li> Signs, Pressure Plates, Diamond Blocks, and Chests usually mean traps. Avoid these things in the open, in houses(Except your own) and in caves.</li></ul>
<p>Aside from those tips, here are the most important rules of trap disarming survival, assuming you know where the trigger is. If you follow these rules, you may not break the trap, but in your reaction to it, you will not die.
</p>
<ol><li> Do not ever trigger the trap the expected way and attempt to outrun it. If that was possible, then the trap would be useless to begin with. Do not trigger it, log out and come back! You may fall in a pit or other measures designed to prevent logging out and surviving.</li>
<li> In the event of suspecting a trap or finding one, the first priority is to retreat the way you came. Although efficient traps just wrap around the kill zone, some traps take huge amounts of space and so are very hard to escape.</li>
<li> Never attempt to dig around a trap. There are many ways to wire redstone and any path you choose may or may not trigger fail-safes.</li>
<li> Destroying pressure plates cannot trigger a trap unless there is an update block in an inactive state next to it. This is the correct way to disarm Mojang's desert temple trap (more than a few youtubers don't seem to know about this and will creep about the chamber looting the boxes without disarming the bomb first).</li>
<li> Only destroy redstone that is inactive and that you safely find if you are sure there is not some kind of occasional pulse that flashes through to check that the line is functioning.</li>
<li> Destroy the components of the trap designed to kill you, if they are reachable and safe to destroy.</li>
<li> Most traps will not be simple pure redstone, instead having a complicated array of redstone or an obscure minecraft feature as a component. These have the downside of causing delay generally, but are hard to disarm.</li>
<li> Do not mess around with anything you are not completely sure about. This basically means that unless you have found the entire trap, do not attempt to jinx it or sabotage it.</li>
<li> Never attempt disarming while you are within "Danger Zone(s)" of the trap.</li></ol>
<p>Lastly, keep in mind that in the real world if you were walking thru the park and you found a tripwire attached to a pipe bomb set up by some maniac you wouldn't try to disarm it yourself. You'd tell someone in authority, who would then send in a specialist wearing explosive resistant armor to disarm it. The minecraft equivalent would be informing the ops so they can send someone in full Blast Protection IV armor to deal with it. But then...where's the fun in that?...

 <p>  <b>Villager trap</b></p> 
<p>A villager trap is a way to move villagers. Once they get far enough they can't go back. The villagers should walk from the right to the left:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/xianjing41.png" />
<br />
</p><p>
This trap takes advantage of the feature where you can't walk through a two-high archway with soulsand in front of it.
</p>

 <h2>Pocket Edition Traps</h2>
  <p>  <b>Death on Impact
</b></p> 
<p>You will need these: Staple blocks, sand, cactus, signs, and a valuable block.
First create a 1-block thin wall, then make a small tunnel on the wall one block higher than the ground, this is where the valuable block goes. Then create a 3x3x24 pit right in front of the wall. Then on the opposite side, dig down 3 blocks so there is enough space for a cactus to be placed inside. Then place sand and cactus in the hole you dug, and place a sign on the top of the cactus. After that, dig another tunnel directly leading to the 3x3x24 pit and place signs on the sign on the cactus so that it goes through the tunnel leading to the pit. And then place signs so that they cover the pit. Then place sand on top of the signs so that it is level with the ground. Then behind the wall, place the valuable block in the small tunnel in the wall. Then place signs on the valuable block. Then place sand on a sign, so that its shadow is beside the cactus. then cover the behind of the wall. The result is a small building with a patch of sand in front of it, the victim will see the valuable block, break it, then is surprised that sand fell in front of him, and then falls on the ground and dies of fall damage, allowing you to take the loot.
</p>

 <p>  <b>House of mobs
</b></p> 
<p>This is a really simple trap to make. This can work on PE LITE, or for more danger, PE (not lite, but instead the paid version). All you need to do is make a fairly large house (doesn't matter how high), and then make a pit 3 blocks deep. Now, just block up the top with the material around on the ground (or wool, if you prefer), and when someone goes to your house, it is likely that due to the dark pit below, they won't be able to sleep in their bed, or will be blown sky high by creepers.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Diamond death tower
</b></p> 
<p>This is another easy trap to make. Create a 3x3 tower at least 24 blocks high out of cobblestone. At the top, grab loads of diamond ore, block or it could just be some other rare and valuable material. You need to make this a 4x4 area, so that there is a little ledge for you to stand on. Then, at the bottom, make a pit 3 blocks deep and about 5 blocks from the tower. You now need to put out a chest and fill it with the dirt you just got from the pit. Then get yourself some sand/gravel and wait at the top.
</p><p>The result:
</p><p>Now, when your victim sees your precious diamond, he can't help but run into the pit, finding himself stuck, and will see a sign, next to the chest saying: use these blocks to get to the top. He will grab the blocks and go in, starting to hop up, and up, and up. At the top, you will then start dropping your sand/gravel down the chute, and then it will fall on him, and they will suffocate.
</p><p>An alternative is to fill the chest with sand, and you stand at the bottom, and when they hop up, you destroy the sand and the pile comes down, preventing him from reaching the top, and when he runs out of material, kill him with a sword.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Simple Hole Trap: The Pocket Edition concept of imprisonment
</b></p> 
<p>This is the simplest trap of all time: Dig a hole 2-3 blocks down. Mobs or players will fall into the hole. Players might dig out, but you can detain and kill them while they are trying to kill them. Mobs cannot dig at all, so you can hit them from above and kill them.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Feet Hitter: Kill your enemies with impunity!
</b></p> 
<p>Build a structure, but with NO BOTTOM BLOCKS!! That way, when mobs try to get to you, their feet are exposed, and you can feet-hit them to death. Easy peasy. Players are more difficult, but you can still deal significant damage.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Dungeon Death
</b></p> 
<p>Locate a dungeon. Then stay there. when your friend finds you, they will find an empty dungeon- filled with zombies&#160;!! Your friend's death, 100% accurate.
</p>

 <p>  <b>What the [DATA EXPUNGED]?
</b></p> 
<p>This is a weird trap. Build a house of TNT, and make a TNT line to some unseen distance. Put a wood block, light it on fire. ( Wood substitute redstone )&gt; After a while, the TNT ignites, and BOOM!! TNT ignites. The person inside the house should think "____" and die. Even if they escape, the amount of TNT blows them sky-high.
</p>

 <p>  <b>Death Temple
</b></p> 

 <p>  <b>Tower o' Ore
</b></p> 
<p>ATTENTION! VALUABLE ORES WILL BE LOST. THIS IS GOOD FOR RICH PEOPLE!!
First make a tower about 3 by 3 about 20 blocks high with a watchtower at the top and TNT in the middle and ladders on the side.
Then you put a block of any ore at the top and say,"Go get it, I'll be up there watching you."
Then you watch him go up the tower and right when he is about to mine it you light the TNT and run.
