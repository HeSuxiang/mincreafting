        <h3>完全隐藏的活塞门</h3>
        <p>这个设计是完全隐藏的，你将看不见任何活塞或红石，而且，这个设计不仅可以从两个方向激活，而且在设计不太复杂，也不占用大量的资源的基础下，仍然可以保证整个设计是完全隐藏的。然而这个设计的缺点是：#1：天花板必须是2块高，否则你必须使门的设计更复杂。 缺点#2 则是门的底部必须从地板中出来，不能从两侧，或像之前提到的一样，你必须使门的设计更复杂。 这个门的设计只是有一点点慢 (大约5个火把的延迟)，且不说这个原因会延缓整个处理过程，但这个设计是能在SMP服务器上顺利的运作的。 更复杂的版本 - 它很容易改变方向的隧道，混乱的人，他们不会看到活塞，使他们没有意识到的路径已经改变。这确实让声音通过，所以一定要确保他们获得远您激活它之前，如果你不希望他们听到它。下面仅视频展示了它是如何工作的，视频教程将作出，如果有很多人在评论中提出要求。</p>

        <h3>进阶的活塞隐藏门</h3>
        <p>The improved hidden piston door is a 'flush inset' 2x2 piston door that can be opened through the use of a redstone torch on a wall. PearSquirrel improved this by compacting it and configuring it with pressure plates on the inside.</p>

        <h3>2x2的地面活塞门</h3>
        <p>This is a secret door with a twist: The blocks aren't being pushed from the sides, they are pushed from the ground and are pushed twice. This design uses a double extender in order to push the blocks 2 up to hide the entrance. Note that this design is space/resource unfriendly thus you'd get more benefits out of it if you used it in a custom map.</p>

        <h3>隐藏门</h3>
        <p>For a door that is completely hidden except the lever/Pressure Plate/Button to power it, you can use a Piston door. A very simple version is one that just moves 2 blocks to the side with 2 Sticky Pistons, which are hidden inside a wall and are powered by Redstone. To make some more complicated and fancy ones, you can get the blocks to move first away from the Player, and then sideways, allowing for 2 wide doors and it also allows you to build it so that the door appears at the middle of a wall, instead of it only being possible to make it either in a corner or in a tunnel of the desired width of the door, because now all the pistons are behind it. You have to do some redstone wiring, though, and if you want to make the door 2 wide it will need at least 12 sticky pistons, 4 to move the blocks into the wall, 4 to move them sideways, and 4 to move the four pistons that moved the blocks sideways sideways. You have to make the delay from the input to the first four pistons, the ones that move the blocks into the wall, 2 ticks. Then split the redstone wires that go to the other 8 pistons; one way has a delay of 1 tick, the other one a delay of 4 ticks. Then after the delays you can join the wires again and bring them to the pistons. To make it more hidden, replace the blocks with bookcases. An example of this can be found below.</p>

          <p>If you really want it to be invisible, remove the button or lever, and instead carry a Redstone torch . Place it where the button was when you are ready to enter. It will stay open until you exit but hey, who carries those things around randomly anyway?</p>
          <p>You can also completely hide your button/lever by putting it underground in a specific place only you know of and once your in it can't be open from the outside. An example of that is below.</p>

          <h3>活塞桌子</h3>
          <p>By placing an upward-facing Piston on top of a Redstone Torch, one can easily and effectively create a 1x1 table.

          <h3>滚动显示</h3>
          <p>This will make a columns of blocks move in sync. Make two rows of a movable material (it can only be 13 blocks long because the piston can only move it that far, can be as tall as you want) and make your image/ message built into it. Use pistons to move the blocks across, then back, the across the other way, back to the front/ beginning.</p>
          <h3>垃圾处理</h3>
          <p>By placing a row of three cobble, then on top of it, a cobble on the left one, and piston (facing right) on the middle one, nothing on the third one and a hole in the ground at the end, one could create a Lava garbage disposal. After following those steps, put a bucketful of lava in the 2 block deep hole at the end, and place a button on the top left block. Unwanted blocks can be 'dropped', using the Q button (by default), onto the top middle block, then, after pushing the button the little blocks will be pushed into the lava. CAUTION! This device does not destroy placed blocks, only dropped icons of blocks. While it does demonstrate concepts of using pistons, and looks cool, this device is not as practical as most other incinerators/garbage disposals, which are much simpler. For example, you could make a small pit of lava and drop items in it manually. After adding a trapdoor, it is a safe efficient way to dispose of unused items. You could also clear out a plus 2 blocks down. Put a sand in the center place a cactus and trapdoor and one that if you fall in you can save yourself.</p>

          <h3>干船坞</h3>
          <p>A dry dock can be made by reversing a floodgate: instead of controlling the liquid, the player is controlling a solid. Place a piston facing upwards in a 1 block deep pool of water and wire this piston to a lever. When a boat comes over the piston, flip the lever to raise the boat out of the water. This will stop the boat from being influenced by currents or being bumped.</p>

          <h3>自我修复建筑</h3>
          <p>Self repairing structures use a piston cobblestone generator to endlessly create blocks that get pushed into place by pistons. The following video shows how to create a cobblestone generator, a simple clock and connect it all together to push cobblestone.</p>

          <p>Self repairing structures are not limited to cobblestone, however, it is by far the easiest material to manipulate as its generation can be fully automated.</p>
          <p>Pistons can only push 12 blocks which limits the scale of the structure. Pistons can not push chests, noteblocks, Obsidian, Bedrock,Mob Spawners, or furnaces, so these can be used to stop a line of blocks before the 12 block limit is reached.</p>
          <h2>陷阱</h2>
          <h3>会消失的地面陷阱</h3>

            <br />Side view of retracted state.
            <br />Note: The piston is a sticky piston. Note: You can use smooth stone or cobblestone instead of sand.</p>
          <p>When triggered, the section of the floor will be withdrawn from below the target. This design is best used inside to hide the pistons and circuitry. This can easily be added to a tunnel. Under the floor, dig out a 2-block deep pit for each of the trap blocks you want to move. Mine out two blocks horizontally from each space where the trap floor will go and put a sticky piston at the back of each hole. In front of the sticky piston, replace the floor blocks (make sure that the trap block is the same as the regular floor blocks so as not to cause suspicion. In the space beneath the floor can be a long drop, lava, dispensers filled with arrows. For simplicity, we chose lava.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/liyonghuoshai3.png" />
            <br />The floor trap when the pistons are activated. Players who activate the pressure plate often have no time to react.</p>
          <p>Triggering this is best done with a pressure plate, however, this can be difficult to hide from other players. You will need to wire the pressure plate to the input of a NOT-gate and the pistons to the output. A delay can be helpful to ensure the player is over the right blocks when the trap triggers, which can be accomplished by putting in redstone repeaters. Stone pressure plates will only trigger when players or mobs walk over, whereas wooden pressure plates trigger also for dropped items. This trap will be reset once the signal from the pressure plates is disabled.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the pistons could be connected to a lever. This requires input from the player, but can be activated when the target is above the trap, which removes the need for a delay.</p>
          <p>You could also use sand or gravel to make a refillable trap as well. Make sure to hide the refilling station for secrecy!</p>
          <p>If you think this is bad, feel free to revert to the previous "version".

          <h3>隐藏的桥</h3>
          <p>Like disappearing floors but in reverse, hidden bridges show an impassible obstacle (usually lava or a long fall) to hinder other players or kill mobs. These bridges can be activated by lever to allow a player to cross then deactivated on the other side or by a set delay, done by placing redstone repeaters and setting the second redstone torch to any four positions (Right clicking it.) Adding multiple repeaters can make a longer delay if necessary.</p>
          <h3>窒息陷阱</h3>
          <p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hesuxiang/mincreafting/wiki/img/liyonghuoshai4.png" />
            <br />Side view of retracted state.</p>
          <p>When a piston moves a block into the same space as the head of a mob or player, the entity takes damage from suffocation. Tunnels work well for this type of trap because the area is small and can hide the parts.</p>
          <p>In a tunnel, mine out the ceiling an additional two blocks high. At the top of every part of the tunnel, place a sticky piston then replace the ceiling with the same material used in the tunnel. This trap can be triggered in a number of ways, the most simple being pressure plate or lever. If you choose to use a lever, this trap can also act as a door, since aggressive mobs won't be able to enter. For this example we'll use pressure plate.</p>
          <p>Since players are pushed into the nearest air pocket to avoid suffocation, the trigger should be in the middle of a series. To ensure the trap doesn't reset too early, add an RS-NOR latch that is either reset manually or by an automatic delay.</p>
          <p>You can also make a piston door, mine two blocks down and place a slab on the bottom block(s) so the griefer/thief who activates it can't escape but can still be suffocated.</p>
          <h3>闸门</h3>
          <p>One of the piston's most important uses is its ability to stop fluids. A floodgate is a device that does just that. Fluids don't destroy pressure plates, which makes them ideal for triggering this trap. In a tunnel, have a pressure plate activate an RS-NOR latch that blocks the player into that tunnel, which will also minimize other damage caused by the fluid. From the same output, have the floodgates open, dropping lava on the target.

          <p>活塞可以用于遮盖或揭开拥有光源的洞。这可以在一个T-Flip Flop上使用一个拉杆或一个按钮来触发。</p>
          <p>Players tend to use glowstone for lighting, however, lava is another viable method. A lava light uses an opaque block to hold the source block of lava from the area it will flow into (generally a glass tube). Since lava can flow, it can be a very space efficient light source. However, lava takes a long time to dissipate. If you need to flip a switch for immediate darkness, flowing lava lamps are not recommended.However, you may want to consider using a Redstone Lamp, as it tends to be more resource friendly.</p>
          <p>Since light levels affect mob spawning, light switches can activate and deactivate a mob farm.</p>

            <br />To speed things up, a player can use an additional piston, a sticky piston and a redstone torch (2 or 3 is preferred) to move the testing piston.</p>
          <p>Pistons can be used to locate caves through solid rock. In order to do so, one places the piston on the ground facing the ground, on the ceiling facing the ceiling, or facing straight into any wall. The piston is then powered. If the piston extends, it indicates an opening within 12 blocks. If it does not extend, then there are at least 12 blocks in that direction. This allows a player to find caves from nothing more than a 2x2 tunnel.</p>
          <p>The effectiveness of this technique is limited. Close caves will have sounds (either mobs or ambient sounds) to indicate whether or not a cave is nearby. The limit of 12 blocks can also hinder this method.</p>
          <p>A variation can be used in a 1x2 passage,</p>

          <p>is a video of it in action. The basic idea is the same except the torches are placed on the wall above the pistons, and you use a piston facing to each side not just one. there are only 2 positions you place torches in, above the side-facing piston which is touching the sticky piston, and above the forward facing piston. As they are wall mounted, placing the torch above the side-facing piston powers both side-facing pistons as well as the sticky piston, saving time.</p>

          <h3>锁箱</h3>
          <p>A chest with an opaque block above it can not be opened. A sticky piston can be used to replace or remove that block, effectively locking the chest and its contents. Note that chests themselves can not be moved by pistons. This can be combined with a combination lock for added security.</p>
          <p>There is a disadvantage, though, griefers/robbers may just break the block protecting the chest or the chest itself.</p>

          <h3>Making Sand Produce Light!</h3>
          <p>First, attach a lever to a NOT gate.</p>
          <p>L = 拉杆</p>
          <p>B = 方块</p>
          <p>R = 红石</p>
          <p>T = 红石火把</p>
          <p>Side View: LBRBT</p>
          <p>Then, attach it to a Redstone Clock.</p>
          <p>P = 中继器 A = 空气</p>
          <p>Top View:</p>
          <p>BRR</p>
          <p>TPR</p>
          <p>AAR</p>
          <p>Note: The repeater is facing the Redstone on the right. It must be set to two ticks.</p>
          <p>On top of the torch, put a piston and then sand.</p>
          <p>I = 活塞 S = 沙子</p>
          <p>Side View:</p>
          <p>S</p>
          <p>I</p>
          <p>When you activate the lever, the sand will go up and down. It will glow. What's more, when the game starts to lag, remove the piston and the sand will still float.</p>
